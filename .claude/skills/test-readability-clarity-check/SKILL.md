## Instructions

The Test Readability and Clarity Check is a dual-agent validation approach that assesses whether a test suite effectively documents system behavior by reconstructing system understanding purely from test code. This approach validates that tests serve as executable specifications and identifies gaps in architectural context documentation.

**Key Insight:
** Tests that allow accurate system reconstruction without external documentation prove their quality as living specification documents.

## Principles

1. Test-as-Documentation
2. Separation of Concerns
3. Dual Perspective
4. Measurable Outcomes
5. Actionable Feedback
## When to Use

- Major test suite refactoring completed (validate improvement)
- New team members onboarding (generate system overview)
- Architecture documentation audit needed (find alignment gaps)
- Quality gate before major release (comprehensive validation)
- Quarterly quality reviews (track test suite evolution)
