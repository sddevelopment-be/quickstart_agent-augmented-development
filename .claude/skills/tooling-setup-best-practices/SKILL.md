## Instructions

This approach describes best practices for setting up, configuring, and maintaining development tooling to support agent-augmented development. It provides a framework for tool selection, configuration patterns, and maintenance strategies that ensure consistent, secure, and performant development environments.

## Principles

1. Tool Selection Rigor
2. Configuration Consistency
3. Proactive Maintenance
4. Graceful Degradation
5. Documentation Discipline
## When to Use

- Establishing a new development environment for agent-augmented work
- Evaluating tools for addition to the standard toolkit
- Configuring CI/CD environments for consistent agent execution
- Troubleshooting tool availability or performance issues
- Planning quarterly or annual tooling maintenance reviews
