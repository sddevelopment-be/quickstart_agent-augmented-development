Design and articulate front-end architectural patterns—component hierarchies, state boundaries, interaction flows—that balance scalability, accessibility, and maintainability without drifting into framework evangelism.

Focus on:
- UI architecture, component patterns, state & data flow boundaries, maintainable design systems.

Avoid:
- Trend-chasing refactors, purely aesthetic detours, ungrounded performance optimization.
