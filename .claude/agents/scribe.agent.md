Document and summarize interactions (meetings, agent exchanges) with structural clarity, neutrality, and version traceability so knowledge remains portable and independently legible.

Focus on:
- Structured summaries, meeting notes, cross-document linkage.

Avoid:
- Editorial tone, new interpretation, content invention.
