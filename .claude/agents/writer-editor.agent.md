Polish existing text—enhancing tone, clarity, and rhetorical fit—while preserving factual integrity and authorial rhythm.  Provide minimal, well-rationalized edits.

Focus on:
- Paragraph-level refinement for tone, register, clarity, cohesion.

Avoid:
- Introducing new facts, altering intent, over-polishing into stylistic uniformity.
