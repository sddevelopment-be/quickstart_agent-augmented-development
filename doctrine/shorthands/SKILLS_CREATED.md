# Skills Created: Session Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Session:** Iteration Orchestration & Framework Skills
**Total Skills Created:** 6 new skills + 1 comprehensive prompt template

---

## Overview

Created a complete iteration orchestration system with skills for multi-agent coordination, bug fixing, specification creation, and self-monitoring. All skills reference comprehensive prompt templates and framework directives.

---

## New Skills

### 1. `/iterate` - Iteration Orchestration ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Command:** `/iterate`
**Location:** `.claude/skills/iterate/SKILL.md`
**Purpose:** Execute complete iteration cycle with multi-agent coordination

**Workflow:**
1. Planning Petra: Assess state, identify next batch
2. Specialist agents: Execute tasks with TDD/ATDD
3. Planning Petra: Update artifacts, executive summary
4. Conditional: Create Architect review task if needed

**Key Features:**
- File-based orchestration (work/collaboration/)
- TDD/ATDD enforcement (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Work log creation (Directive 014)
- Quality gates (>80% test coverage target)
- Agent handoff patterns

**Example Usage:**
```
User: /iterate

Agent (Petra): Starting M2 Batch 2.3 (2 tasks)...
Agent (Backend-Dev): [Implements with TDD, 44 tests pass, 92% coverage]
Agent (Petra): ✅ Batch complete, 5h actual vs 7h estimated
  Next: M3 Batch 3.1 - Telemetry Infrastructure
```

---

### 2. `/status` - Planning State Assessment ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Command:** `/status`
**Location:** `.claude/skills/status/SKILL.md`
**Purpose:** Planning Petra's executive view of current state

**Provides:**
- Current milestone progress (% complete)
- Task queue overview (inbox/assigned/done by priority)
- Blockers or decisions needed
- Next recommended batch (2-4 tasks, estimated time)
- Overall project health: ON TRACK | AT RISK | BLOCKED

**Best Practice:** Start every session with `/status` before `/iterate`

**Example Usage:**
```
User: /status

Agent (Petra):
  Current: M2 Tool Integration - 75% complete
  Inbox: 3 tasks (2 high, 1 medium)
  Next batch: M2 Batch 2.3 (2 tasks, ~5h)
  Health: 🟢 ON TRACK
```

---

### 3. `/review` - Architect Code Review ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Command:** `/review`
**Location:** `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md`
**Purpose:** Architect Alphonso conducts rigorous code review

**Review Areas:**
- ADR compliance verification
- Test coverage assessment (>80% target)
- Architectural patterns validation
- Security considerations
- Performance implications

**Output Status:**
- ✅ APPROVED - Ready to proceed
- 🔄 REDIRECT - Changes needed, then re-review
- 🛑 BLOCKED - Major issues, fundamental rethink

**Documents Review:** `work/reports/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-review.md`

**Example Usage:**
```
User: /review

Agent (Alphonso):
  Reviewed: M2 Batch 2.3 - Generic YAML Adapter
  Status: ✅ APPROVED
  - ADR-029 compliance: ✅
  - Test coverage: 92% (excellent)
  - Security: ✅ ENV validation present
  Minor: Add type hints (low priority)
  Next: Proceed to M3
```

---

### 4. `/fix-bug` - Test-First Bug Fixing ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Command:** `/fix-bug`
**Location:** `.claude/skills/fix-bug/SKILL.md`
**Purpose:** Systematic bug resolution with proof of fix

**Golden Rule:**
> Before you change production code, write a test that fails because of the bug.

**Process:**
1. **Phase 1: Write failing test** (DO THIS FIRST)
   - Choose test level (unit/integration/acceptance)
   - Reproduce bug in test
   - Verify test FAILS for right reason
   - Commit failing test

2. **Phase 2: Fix the code**
   - Minimal change to pass test
   - Test transitions RED → GREEN
   - Run ALL tests (no regressions)

3. **Phase 3: Commit fix**
   - Document root cause
   - Link to test file

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Proof bug existed
- ✅ Proof bug is fixed
- ✅ Regression prevention
- ✅ Fast feedback (no deployment)
- ✅ Documents the issue

**Example Usage:**
```
User: Bug - API returns 500 for special characters

Agent (Backend-Dev):
  Phase 1: Reproduce bug
  - Created test: tests/test_api_special_chars.py
  - Test FAILS ❌ (assert 500 == 200)
  - Committed failing test

  Phase 2: Fix code
  - Root cause: Missing input sanitization
  - Fixed: Added html.escape() in processor
  - Test PASSES ✅

  Phase 3: Commit fix
  - All tests: 127/127 PASSED ✅
  - Committed with test reference
```

---

### 5. `/spec-create` - Specification Creation ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Command:** `/spec-create`
**Location:** `.claude/skills/spec-create/SKILL.md`
**Purpose:** Create comprehensive functional specifications

**When to Use:**
- ✅ Complex features spanning multiple components
- ✅ Features requiring cross-team coordination
- ✅ API contracts needing stakeholder agreement
- ✅ Features with security/performance constraints

**Skip For:**
- ❌ Simple CRUD operations
- ❌ Bug fixes (use /fix-bug)
- ❌ Architectural decisions (use ADRs)

**Spec Structure:**
- User story (As a/I want/So that)
- Functional requirements (MoSCoW: MUST/SHOULD/COULD/WON'T)
- Scenarios (Given/When/Then format)
- Constraints and business rules
- Non-functional requirements
- Open questions and decisions
- Acceptance criteria summary
- Traceability (strategic → tactical)

**Lifecycle:**
1. Draft → Review → Approved → Implemented

**Location:** `specifications/[domain]/[feature-name].md`

**Example Usage:**
```
User: We need a real-time execution dashboard

Agent (Scribe Sally):
  Creating specification...
  - Feature: Real-Time Execution Dashboard
  - Personas: Software Engineer (primary)
  - Requirements: 8 MUST, 5 SHOULD, 4 COULD, 4 WON'T
  - Scenarios: 6 (4 happy path, 2 error cases)
  - Constraints: <100ms latency, localhost-only
  - Location: specifications/llm-dashboard/real-time-execution-dashboard.md
  Status: DRAFT → Ready for stakeholder review
```

---

### 6. `/self-check` - Self-Observation Protocol ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Command:** `/self-check`
**Location:** `.claude/skills/self-check/SKILL.md`
**Purpose:** Mid-execution checkpoint to detect drift and course-correct

**Mandatory Checkpoints:**
- 25% task completion (early warning)
- Before delegating tasks to other agents
- After loading 5+ directives or large documents
- When 3+ ⚠️ symbols appear within 10 minutes
- Before marking task complete

**Checkpoint Protocol:**
1. Enter meta-mode
2. Document checkpoint header
3. Run self-observation checklist
4. Pattern recognition (drift/confusion/gold-plating)
5. Course correction
6. Exit meta-mode

**Warning Patterns Detected:**
- Goal drift (scope creep)
- Confusion (uncertainty accumulating)
- Gold-plating (over-engineering)
- Repetition (same approach multiple times)
- Speculation (guessing without validation)
- Mode misuse (wrong reasoning mode)

**Results:**
- ✅ Aligned - Continue
- ⚠️ Corrected - Adjustments made
- ❗️ Blocked - Stop, request guidance

**Example Usage:**
```
Agent: [At 25% completion]

🔄 Self-Check Checkpoint
  Task: Implement GenericYAMLAdapter
  Progress: 3/12 steps (25%)
  Warning: [x] Scope creep (added caching not in requirements)
  Pattern: Gold-plating
  Correction: Removed 45 lines of caching code
  Result: ⚠️ Corrected - Refocused on core requirements
  Resuming: Step 4 - ENV variable expansion
```

2. /iterate         → Execute batch
   ├─ /self-check   → Mid-execution checkpoint (25%, 50%, 75%)
   ├─ /fix-bug      → If bugs encountered
   └─ /spec-create  → If complex feature needs spec first
3. /review          → Architect approval
4. /status          → Check next batch
