# Concept Template

**Purpose:** Document abstract ideas, theories, principles, and conceptual frameworks.

**When to use:** Explaining foundational ideas, mental models, or theoretical concepts that underpin practices.

**Related:** For operational patterns, use `pattern-template.md`; for decisions, use `architecture/adr-template.md`.

## Concept Name

**Subtitle:** [Optional catchy subtitle that captures the essence]

### Definition

> Offer a precise, clear definition of the concept. What is it fundamentally? Avoid jargon where possible; if domain-specific terms are necessary, define them inline or link to glossary entries.

### Key Components

> Break down the concept into its most important component ideas. Start with a list of components with brief explanations, then provide fuller explanation below if needed.

- **Component 1:** Brief explanation of this element
- **Component 2:** Brief explanation of this element  
- **Component 3:** Brief explanation of this element

#### Detailed Explanation

> Optional: Expand on the components with fuller prose explanation, showing how they relate to form the complete concept.

### Background

#### Origin

> Provide a brief history of the concept, including its origins and evolution over time. Who developed it? When? In what context? How has it evolved?

#### Application

> Explain how the concept is applied in practice from a high-level perspective. This section should clarify the concept's purpose and value without diving into procedural details (use pattern templates for that).

#### Comparisons

> Compare the concept with related ideas to highlight its unique aspects. Make clear distinctions using examples that illustrate both similarities and differences.

**vs. [Related Concept 1]:**
> Brief comparison highlighting the key distinction.

**vs. [Related Concept 2]:**
> Another comparison showing how this concept differs or complements.

### Significance

> Why does this concept matter? What problems does it help us understand or solve? What new perspectives does it enable?

### Examples

> Illustrate how the concept manifests in specific scenarios. These should clarify the abstract idea without necessarily showing step-by-step application (that's for pattern templates).

#### Example 1: [Domain / Context]

> Concrete illustration showing the concept in a specific domain.

#### Example 2: [Domain / Context]

> Another example from a different context to show breadth of applicability.

### Misconceptions

> Address common misunderstandings about this concept. What do people often get wrong? What oversimplifications should be avoided?

- **Misconception 1:** Clarification
- **Misconception 2:** Clarification

### Related Concepts

> List and briefly describe related concepts that readers should understand for full context.

- **[Concept Name]:** Brief explanation of relationship
- **[Concept Name]:** Brief explanation of relationship

### Practical Implications

> Bridge from abstract concept to practical application. What should practitioners know? How does understanding this concept change behavior or decision-making?

## Template Usage Notes

**Filling out this template:**

1. **Definition** - Start with clarity. A reader should be able to explain the concept to someone else after reading this section.

2. **Key Components** - Decompose the concept systematically. What are its essential parts?

3. **Background** - Provide just enough history to contextualize. Avoid extended historical digressions.

4. **Comparisons** - This helps readers place the concept in their existing mental models. Use concrete examples.

5. **Examples** - Make the abstract tangible. Show the concept in action without making it a "how-to."

6. **Misconceptions** - Preemptively address confusion. What do people typically misunderstand?

**Deletion-safe sections:** If a section doesn't apply, delete it rather than leaving placeholder text.

**Voice:** Write in clear, explanatory prose. Aim for accessibility without sacrificing precision.

**Concept vs. Practice:** Concepts explain *what* and *why* (ideas, principles). Practices explain *how* (application, implementation). If you're describing how to do something, use the pattern template instead.
