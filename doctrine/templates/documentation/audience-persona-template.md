## Template Usage Notes

**Filling out this template:**

1. **Overview** - Establish the persona's identity quickly. What role do they play? What context do they operate in?

2. **Core Motivations** - Understand *why* they care. What drives their engagement with documentation?

3. **Desiderata** - Be specific about needs. Vague "wants clear documentation" isn't actionable; "needs step-by-step examples with code snippets" is.

4. **Frustrations** - Honest assessment of pain points guides empathy. What obstacles do they face?

5. **Behavioral Cues** - How do they act in different scenarios? This guides tone and format choices.

6. **Collaboration Preferences** - How do they work with others? This shapes interactive documentation patterns.

7. **Measures of Success** - How do they define "done"? This clarifies what documentation should enable.

8. **Narrative Summary** - Bring the persona to life. Make them memorable for content creators.

**Deletion-safe sections:** If a section doesn't apply, delete it rather than leaving placeholder text.

**Voice:** Write in clear, observational prose. Avoid stereotypes; base personas on research or real user feedback.

**How many personas?** Start with 2-3 primary personas. More than 5 becomes unwieldy.

**Usage in practice:**
- Reference personas when planning documentation structure
- Use desiderata table to audit existing documentation gaps
- Cite personas in content reviews to justify tone/depth choices
- Update personas quarterly based on user feedback

**Integration with writing workflow:**
1. **Planning phase:** Select target persona(s) for new documentation
2. **Drafting phase:** Write for that persona's desiderata and communication preferences
3. **Review phase:** Validate content against persona's behavioral cues and success measures
4. **Revision phase:** Adjust tone/depth/structure based on persona fit assessment
