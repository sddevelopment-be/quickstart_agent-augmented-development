# Pattern Template

**Purpose:** Document operational patterns, practices, and organizational techniques using forces-based analysis.

**When to use:** Describing proven approaches with contextual trade-offs (solutions with enablers and deterrents).

**Related:** For architectural decisions, use `architecture/adr-template.md`; for abstract ideas, use `concept-template.md`.

## Pattern Name

### Problem Statement

> Describe the problem that this pattern aims to solve. Be specific about symptoms, pain points, and the context in which this problem manifests.

### Intent

> Describe the desired outcome, focusing on the goals and expectations. What values does applying this pattern support? What changes when this pattern is successfully implemented?

### Solution

> Describe the core idea of the pattern and how to apply it. Break into subsections as needed to clearly communicate the approach.

#### Implementation Steps

> Optional: Provide step-by-step guidance for applying the pattern.

#### Key Principles

> Optional: Highlight the fundamental concepts that make this pattern work.

### Contextual Forces

> Explain why this pattern makes sense in certain contexts and not others. Be objective and specific about the conditions that influence its effectiveness.

#### Enablers

The following factors support effective application of the practice:

> - **Factor 1:** Contextual condition that increases viability
> - **Factor 2:** Environmental characteristic that enables success
> - **Factor 3:** Organizational capability that supports adoption

#### Deterrents

The following factors prevent effective application of the practice:

> - **Factor 1:** Contextual condition that decreases viability
> - **Factor 2:** Environmental characteristic that blocks success
> - **Factor 3:** Organizational constraint that prevents adoption

### Rationale

> Explain the reasoning behind the pattern. Go into detail on *why* it works. Reference underlying principles, research, or established practices that support this approach.

### Application

#### Consequences

While the approach brings numerous benefits, it can also lead to several unexpected or undesired outcomes:

> - **Positive consequence:** Describe beneficial outcomes beyond the stated intent
> - **Negative consequence:** Describe potential downsides or trade-offs
> - **Unexpected consequence:** Describe second-order or emergent effects

#### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the potential negative consequences of the approach:

> - **Strategy 1:** How to reduce or prevent specific negative outcomes
> - **Strategy 2:** Compensating practices to balance trade-offs
> - **Strategy 3:** Monitoring approaches to detect issues early

### Examples

> Provide concrete examples, case studies, or testimonials that illustrate the pattern in action. Include both successful applications and instructive failures.

#### Example 1: [Context Description]

> Brief narrative showing pattern application in a specific scenario.

#### Example 2: [Context Description]

> Another example highlighting different aspects or variations.

### Criticism & Clarifications

> Address common misunderstandings, critiques, or limitations of this pattern. Provide alternative viewpoints or competing approaches when relevant.

#### Common Misconceptions

> - **Misconception:** Clarification

#### When NOT to Use

> Specific situations where this pattern is inappropriate or counterproductive.

#### Alternatives

> - **Alternative pattern:** Brief comparison highlighting when to choose each

## Template Usage Notes

**Filling out this template:**

1. **Problem Statement** - Start by clearly defining the problem. If readers can't recognize the problem, they won't see value in the solution.

2. **Intent** - Focus on desired outcomes, not implementation details. What changes when this pattern succeeds?

3. **Solution** - Describe the approach clearly, but avoid prescriptive step-by-step instructions unless the pattern requires precise execution.

4. **Forces** - This is critical: be honest about enablers and deterrents. Patterns without trade-offs are suspect.

5. **Consequences** - Include both positive and negative outcomes. Acknowledging downsides builds trust.

6. **Examples** - Concrete examples make abstract patterns tangible. Use real scenarios when possible.

**Deletion-safe sections:** If a section doesn't apply, delete it rather than leaving placeholder text.

**Voice:** Write in clear, neutral prose. Avoid hype, motivational language, or unsubstantiated claims.
