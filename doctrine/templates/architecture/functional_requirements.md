# Functional Requirements

## Business Statement

Briefly describe the problem that the system is intended to solve. How it aims to solve it, and what the expected benefits are.
Write this in a way that is understandable to all stakeholders, not just technical people. Think of it as your 2-minute management pitch on which you can expand if people are interested.

## Stakeholders Overview

A short summary of the key people / personas that will interact with the system in some way. Be sure to include the developers, testers, and
your organization, as well as the envisioned customers and end-users.

| Persona name | Description                                                          | Cares about                                                                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Developers   | Technical staff implementing new features, and maintaining the code. | Clarity in code, easy-to-read documentation, ability to be creative, speed of change |

## Top-level functional requirements

> A very short list of the most important features that the system must have. These are the features that are most important to the
> stakeholders, and that will be used to prioritize the work later on. You can format these as a bullet list, or as a table.
> It is advisable to add an indication of the relative importance of each feature, to help with prioritization.
> A light-weight way to do this is to use the MoSCoW method, where you indicate if a feature is `Must-have`, `Should-have`, `Could-have`, or
> `Won't-have`.

| feature identifier | MoSCoW        | Status     | Description                                                      |
|--------------------|---------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name or UUID       | `Must-have`   | `Accepted` | A short description of the feature, or link to the detailed FR's |
| Name or UUID       | `Should-have` | `Proposed` | A short description of the feature, or link to the detailed FR's |
| Name or UUID       | `Should-have` | `Proposed` | A short description of the feature, or link to the detailed FR's |
| Name or UUID       | `Could-have`  | `Proposed` | A short description of the feature, or link to the detailed FR's |
| Name or UUID       | `Won't-have`  | `Rejected` | reason: Unrealistic, and unneeded                                |

## Detailed functional requirements

This section explains a selection of the most important functional requirements in more detail. It should provide enough context for the
reader to understand what the system is supposed to do, and how it is supposed to do it. The target audience is business analysts,
developers, and architects.

> Describe your most important functional requirements in more detail. Add as much context as you wish, and describe the functionalities as
> detailed as required so your colleagues/team/stakeholders understand them easily. You can use a table, a bullet list, or a more narrative
> style. Make sure to include the rationale behind the requirements, and the expected benefits of implementing them.
> If you have a lot of requirements, you can split them up into separate documents, and link to them from here. If you intend to write
> detailed implementation designs (such as exemplified in the `Technical Design Template`) you can link those as well.

### FR-001: Requirement Name

**status**: `Proposed` / `Accepted` / `Rejected` / `Planned` / `Implemented`  
**MoSCoW**: `Must-have` / `Should-have` / `Could-have` / `Won't-have`

> Describe the requirement in detail. What is the expected behaviour of the system? What are the inputs and outputs?
>
> A good way to structure this is to use a short statement in the  *"As a ... I want to ... so that ..."*-format, as it helps to keep the
> requirement focused on the stakeholder needs.
>
> Make sure to include the rationale behind the requirement, and the expected benefits of implementing it.
> Consider adding a BPMN diagram, a sequence diagram, or a flowchart to illustrate the requirement.
