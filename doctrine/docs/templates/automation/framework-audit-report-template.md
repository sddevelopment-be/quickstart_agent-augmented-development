> Generated by: Framework Guardian Agent

## 1. Summary

- Overall status: {{OK / DRIFT / OUTDATED / PARTIAL}}
- Core directories checked:
    - `.github/agents/`
    - `${DOC_ROOT}/templates/`
    - `docs/directives/`
    - `docs/guidelines/`
    - `validation/`
    - `work/` (structure only)

**High-level findings (1–3 bullets):**

- {{e.g., "Most core files match v1.2.0; some agents diverged locally."}}
- {{e.g., "Local customizations detected in .github/agents/editor.agent.md."}}
- {{e.g., "Missing validation/ files from latest framework version."}}

---

## 2. Core vs Local Overview

### 2.1 Core Paths

Core-managed directories (from MANIFEST):

- {{list of core paths, e.g. `.github/agents/core/`, `${DOC_ROOT}/templates/agent-tasks/`, ...}}

The following files are **up-to-date** with the reference framework:

- {{file list or summary}}

The following files are **missing** but expected by the framework:

- {{file list}}

The following files **exist locally but are unknown** to the framework:

- {{file list or summary}}

### 2.2 Local Overrides & Customizations

Detected local override directories:

- `local/`
- `local_agents/`
- `local_guidelines/`
- {{any other project-specific paths}}

Local agents and guidelines that overlap with core definitions:

- {{e.g., "local/agents/lexical.agent.md (overrides core lexical agent)"}}
- {{e.g., "local/guidelines/lexical-pass.md (extends core guideline)"}}

**Notes:**

- {{short commentary on whether overrides look intentional / healthy}}

## 3. Divergence Details

### 3.1 Modified Core Files

The following core-managed files differ from the framework reference:

| File                                      | Status        | Notes                                |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `.github/agents/lexical.agent.md`         | modified      | local tweaks to directives           |
| `${DOC_ROOT}/templates/agent-tasks/structural.md`| modified      | custom task fields added             |
| `validation/PORTABILITY_RUN.md`          | modified      | extended for this project            |

For each modified file, the Guardian should summarise:

- **What changed?**
- **Is the change clearly project-specific or a likely accidental drift?**
- **Should this be moved to a local override?**

> Example entry format:
> - `.github/agents/lexical.agent.md`
    >   - Change: directives and examples adjusted for this project’s tone.
>   - Likely: intentional local customization.
>   - Suggestion: consider relocating to `local/agents/lexical.agent.md` to keep core clean.

### 3.2 Missing / Outdated Files

Files expected by the framework but missing or outdated:

| File                                       | Type       | Suggested Action                      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| `docs/directives/directive_minimal-diffs.md` | missing  | copy from framework_core              |
| `validation/task-schema.yaml`              | outdated   | replace with latest version           |

---

### 3.3 Task & Orchestration Structure

Check `work/` directory structure and task YAML:

- `work/inbox/` present: {{yes/no}}
- `work/assigned/` present: {{yes/no}}
- `work/done/` present: {{yes/no}}
- `task-schema.yaml` present and referenced: {{yes/no}}

Notes on orchestration health:

- {{e.g., "Task YAMLs follow schema, directives/guidelines fields in use."}}
- {{e.g., "Some tasks lack agent field; recommend enforcing schema."}}

## 4. Guardrails, Guidelines, and Directives Health

### 4.1 Guardrails / Context

Files:

- `.github/agents/general_guidelines.md`
- `docs/VISION.md`
- `docs/specific_guidelines.md`

Assessment:

- {{Are they present? Drifted? Outdated vs framework reference?}}

### 4.2 Guidelines (Approaches)

- List core guidelines found:
    - {{guideline names}}
- List local guidelines:
    - {{local guideline names}}

Issues / observations:

- {{e.g., "Local guideline 'architecture-note' does not reference core directives."}}

### 4.3 Directives (Micro-patterns)

- Core directives:
    - {{directive names}}
- Local directives:
    - {{local directive names}}

Conflicts / gaps:

- {{e.g., "Directive 'minimal-diffs' exists in both core and local with different wording."}}

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 Safe, Low-Risk Improvements

- {{short, actionable bullet list}}

### 5.2 Suggested Refactors (Core vs Local)

- {{e.g., "Move modified lexical agent to local/agents/lexical.agent.md and restore core version."}}

### 5.3 Optional Enhancements

- {{e.g., "Introduce new directive 'explicit-impact' based on recurring patterns in local changes."}}
