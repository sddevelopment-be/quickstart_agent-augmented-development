# Technical Design: Feature Name

## Context

> Describe the context in which this feature is being developed. What are the forces at play, and what are the constraints?
> This section should describe the problem you are trying to solve, and the current state of the application. Refer to sections from the 
> functional requirements and design vision documents where applicable (and to avoid repeating yourself).

## Acceptance Criteria

> Describe the acceptance criteria for this feature. What are the conditions that need to be met for this feature to be considered done?
> Make sure to include both functional and non-functional requirements in this section. Write them in a way that is understandable to 
> everyone involved, and that can be used as a basis for testing. Using minimal SMART objectives can be a good way to structure this section.
> If your project has a Definition of Done, consider including or referencing it here.

## Design

### Overview

> Describe the high-level design of the feature. What are the key components, and how do they interact?
> This section should provide a high-level overview of the feature, and should be understandable to all stakeholders, not just developers.

### Implementation Considerations

> Describe the key implementation considerations for this feature. What are the trade-offs that were made, and why?
> This section should provide enough context for the developers to understand the design decisions that were made, and to implement the feature.
> It should also provide enough context for the stakeholders to understand the impact of the feature on the system as a whole.

### Cross-cutting concerns

> Describe the cross-cutting concerns that are relevant to this feature. What are the security, performance, and scalability considerations?
> These are concerns that are relevant to the system as a whole, though they do not directly contribute to the core functionality of the 
> system. They should be taken into account when implementing any feature, both while estimating and executing the work.
> As always, remove any header that is not relevant to your feature, and add any that are missing. It helps to reference the relevant 
> high-level documents in this section, to provide context to the reader and avoid repeating the same rationale (DRY principle).

#### Security

#### Performance

#### Deployment

#### Auditing and Logging

## Planning

> A bullet list with some high-level planning information. This can include the estimated development time, the estimated rollout time, time 
> to complete the testing cycle, the urgency of the feature, and the estimated added value. Feel free to add metrics that are relevant to 
> your decision-making process. This section can be omitted if these metrics are not relevant to your project or if they are being tracked 
> in other tooling (e.g. Jira, excel). If dependencies are present, make sure to list them here.
