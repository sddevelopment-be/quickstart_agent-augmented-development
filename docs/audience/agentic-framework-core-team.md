## Core Motivations

> *What drives this team in their role? These motivations shape framework design decisions and priorities.*

* **Professional Drivers:**
  Create a reusable, portable orchestration framework that reduces the friction of deploying AI agents in development workflows. Success means other teams can adopt and adapt this system with minimal overhead.

* **Emotional or Cognitive Drivers:**
  Curiosity about emergent agent behaviors and multi-agent collaboration patterns. Satisfaction comes from watching agents successfully execute complex tasks autonomously while staying within defined guardrails.

* **Systemic Positioning:**
  Framework maintainers and infrastructure providers. They enable other agents and developers to work more efficiently but rarely perform end-user tasks themselves. They are facilitators, not operators.

## Desiderata

> *What this team needs from the system, users, and collaborators to succeed.*

| Category    | Expectation / Need | Description                                         |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Information | Agent execution logs with token metrics and decision rationales | Detailed work logs (per Directive 014) showing agent reasoning, challenges encountered, and patterns emerging from task execution. |
| Interaction | Clear feedback from agent users on pain points and edge cases | Structured feedback on orchestration friction, directive ambiguities, and missing capabilities. Prefer GitHub issues or structured reports over ad-hoc messages. |
| Support     | Community participation in directive refinement and template improvements | Pull requests, suggestions, and validation of new agent profiles or directives. Access to diverse use cases to test framework portability. |
| Governance  | Transparency in agent behavior and decision-making | All agents must document reasoning, expose assumptions, and flag uncertainties. Framework evolution depends on traceable agent actions. |

## Frustrations and Constraints

> *Systemic and practical challenges that make this team's work harder.*

* **Pain Points:**
  - **Context window limitations:** Balancing comprehensive agent guidance with token efficiency is an ongoing challenge. Directives must be modular yet complete.
  - **Emergence vs. control tension:** Agents need autonomy to be useful, but too much autonomy creates unpredictable behaviors. Finding the right guardrail balance is difficult.
  - **Adoption friction:** New users struggle with the orchestration model's file-based nature and explicit handoff mechanisms. Better onboarding materials are always needed.
  - **Cross-LLM compatibility:** Different LLM providers interpret instructions with varying fidelity. Ensuring portability requires careful directive phrasing.

* **Trade-Off Awareness:**
  - Stricter governance improves consistency but reduces agent flexibility
  - More detailed directives improve behavior but increase token usage
  - Template standardization improves quality but may constrain creative solutions

* **Environmental Constraints:**
  - **Token budgets:** Operating within LLM context window limits forces constant prioritization
  - **Time:** Framework development competes with operational tasks in the same repositories
  - **Fragmentation risk:** Without discipline, directives and profiles can proliferate inconsistently

## Behavioral Cues

> *How this team behaves under different conditions—useful for interaction design.*

| Situation            | Typical Behavior | Interpretation |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Stable / Routine     | Systematic refinement of existing directives based on work log analysis. Regular validation passes on framework integrity. | They value incremental improvement and evidence-based iteration. Prefer small, tested changes over large refactors. |
| Change / Uncertainty | Research and experimentation phases—creating proof-of-concept agents, testing new coordination patterns, soliciting feedback. | They embrace uncertainty as learning opportunities but need clear success criteria and rollback plans. |
| Under Pressure       | Pragmatic triage—focus on high-impact issues, defer nice-to-haves, escalate blockers quickly. Communication becomes more concise and action-oriented. | They prioritize framework stability and user unblocking over feature completeness. Appreciate clear problem statements and reproducible examples. |

## Collaboration Preferences

> *How this team prefers to work and communicate—essential for effective coordination.*

* **Decision Style:**
  Evidence-driven with a bias toward experimentation. Prefer concrete examples (work logs, agent transcripts) over abstract discussions. Value "show, don't tell" approaches.

* **Communication Style:**
  Direct, technical, and concise. Appreciate structured formats (GitHub issues, templates, work logs) over free-form narratives. Favor asynchronous communication that allows deep work time.

* **Feedback Expectations:**
  Specific, actionable, and grounded in real use cases. Ideal feedback includes:
  - Exact directive or agent profile causing confusion
  - Screenshot or transcript of problematic behavior
  - Suggestion for improvement (optional but valued)
  - Context about use case and expected outcome

## Narrative Summary

The Agentic Framework Core Team are the architects behind a multi-agent orchestration system designed to augment software development workflows with autonomous AI assistants. They operate at the cutting edge of LLM application development, balancing the promise of agent autonomy with the practical need for predictable, governable behavior.

This team is motivated by curiosity about emergent AI collaboration patterns and a commitment to building reusable infrastructure that others can adopt. They think in systems—designing directives, templates, and protocols that shape how agents initialize, reason, and collaborate. Their success depends on transparency: agents must document their reasoning, expose assumptions, and generate work logs that reveal both successes and failures.

Frustrations center on context window constraints, the tension between control and autonomy, and the challenge of making a file-based orchestration model feel natural to developers accustomed to traditional CI/CD systems. They value evidence over opinion, preferring work logs and agent transcripts to abstract feedback. Communication is direct, technical, and structured—GitHub issues and templates are their native language.

This team measures success not just by framework stability but by community adoption and agent learning. When work logs show agents reasoning correctly, citing directives, and adapting to novel situations, they know the system is working. When new contributors add agent profiles or refine directives, they see validation of the framework's portability. They are facilitators and infrastructure builders, enabling others to benefit from AI augmentation without becoming bottlenecks themselves.
