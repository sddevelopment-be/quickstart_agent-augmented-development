# Architecture Patterns

Purpose: Capture reusable architectural patterns and guidance for the agent-augmented framework.

What belongs: Pattern writeups, rationale, examples, and references.  
What doesn’t: Module-specific implementation notes (use design docs) or ideation drafts (use `work/notes/`).
