!define INBOX #E1F5FF
!define ASSIGNED #FFF9E1
!define PROCESSING #FFE082
!define DONE #E8F5E9

actor "Planning\nAgent" as Planning
database "work/inbox/" as Inbox INBOX
participant "Coordinator\nAgent" as Coordinator
database "work/assigned/\nstructural/" as AssignedS ASSIGNED
participant "Structural\nAgent" as Structural PROCESSING
database "work/done/" as Done1 DONE
database "work/inbox/" as Inbox2 INBOX
database "work/assigned/\nlexical/" as AssignedL ASSIGNED
participant "Lexical\nAgent" as Lexical PROCESSING
database "work/done/" as Done2 DONE

== Step 1: Initial Task Creation ==

Planning -> Inbox: Create task YAML
note right
  task-001.yaml:
    agent: structural
    status: new
    artefacts: [REPO_MAP.md]
end note

== Step 2: Assignment to First Agent ==

Coordinator -> Inbox: Poll for new tasks
Coordinator -> AssignedS: Move & assign task
note right
  Update status: assigned
  Add assigned_at timestamp
end note

== Step 3: First Agent Execution ==

Structural -> AssignedS: Poll & pickup task
Structural -> Structural: Update status: in_progress
activate Structural
Structural -> Structural: Generate REPO_MAP.md
Structural -> Done1: Complete with next_agent
deactivate Structural
note right
  result:
    summary: "REPO_MAP created"
    artefacts: [REPO_MAP.md]
    next_agent: lexical
    next_task_title: "Refine REPO_MAP"
end note

== Step 4: Handoff to Second Agent ==

Coordinator -> Done1: Detect next_agent
Coordinator -> Inbox2: Create follow-up task
note right
  task-002.yaml:
    agent: lexical
    status: new
    artefacts: [REPO_MAP.md]
    dependencies: [task-001]
    created_by: structural
end note

== Step 5: Assignment to Second Agent ==

Coordinator -> Inbox2: Poll for new tasks
Coordinator -> AssignedL: Move & assign task

== Step 6: Second Agent Execution ==

Lexical -> AssignedL: Poll & pickup task
Lexical -> Lexical: Update status: in_progress
activate Lexical
Lexical -> Lexical: Refine REPO_MAP.md
Lexical -> Done2: Complete (no next_agent)
deactivate Lexical
note right
  result:
    summary: "REPO_MAP refined"
    artefacts: [REPO_MAP.md]
    completed_at: timestamp
end note

== Workflow Complete ==

note over Planning, Done2
  Sequential workflow completed successfully
  Two agents collaborated via coordinator handoff
end note
