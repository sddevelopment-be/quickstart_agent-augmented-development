## What Was Delivered

### Deliverable 1: Experiment Primer (Primary)
- **File:** experiment-primer.md
- **Size:** 481 lines, ~18,850 characters
- **Reading Time:** ~15 minutes
- **Content:** 10 sections covering hypothesis, mechanism, governance, failure modes, success criteria

**Key Sections:**
1. Hypothesis: Language drift as architectural signal
2. Mechanism: Agents as drift detectors
3. Governance: Human in charge
4. Integration: Where it fits in delivery
5. Failure modes: 6 major risks with mitigations
6. Success criteria: Early detection, improved conversations, reduced coupling
7. Key concepts: DDD, Conway's Law, concept-based design
8. Differentiation: vs traditional glossaries and code review
9. Open questions: For research validation
10. Next steps: Path forward

**Quality Gates Met:** ✅
- Explains hypothesis clearly
- Describes mechanism without jargon
- Documents governance model
- Identifies failure modes with mitigations
- Can a tired engineer read this and act differently? **Yes.**

### Deliverable 2: Annotated Reading List (Supporting)
- **File:** reading-list.md
- **Size:** 488 lines, ~20,400 characters
- **Content:** 10 source categories, 20+ sources with detailed annotations

**Categories:**
1. Domain-Driven Design / Ubiquitous Language (Evans, Vernon)
2. Conway's Law and Team Topologies (Conway, Skelton & Pais)
3. Concept-Based Design (Wirfs-Brock, Jackson)
4. Evolutionary Architecture (Ford et al.)
5. DDD Community Resources (DDD-Crew)
6. Software Linguistics (Bavota, Arnaoudova)
7. Sociolinguistics (Cameron, Swales)
8. Privacy and Ethics (Kerr, Nissenbaum)
9. Meta-Research (Waterman)
10. Tools (Contextive)

**Annotations Include:**
- Why this source matters for the experiment
- Which sections/chapters are high value
- What claims or concepts should be extracted
- Where the source is prescriptive vs descriptive

**Copyright Strategy:** ✅
- Hybrid approach (human reads, agent synthesizes notes)
- No copyrighted text reproduced
- Fair use citations only
- Respects intellectual property boundaries

---

### Deliverable 3: Concept Map (Supporting)
- **File:** concept-map.md
- **Size:** 707 lines, ~23,000 characters
- **Content:** 10 Mermaid diagrams + concept inventory

**Diagrams:**
1. Core concept network (central hypothesis)
2. Layered view (theory → practice)
3. Workflow view (agent roles and artifacts)
4. DDD core concepts
5. Conway's Law and Team Topologies
6. Agentic feasibility shift
7. Governance and enforcement
8. Failure mode network
9. Success metrics network
10. Cross-cutting concerns

**Concept Inventory:**
- 8 primary concepts (core to experiment)
- 8 secondary concepts (supporting)
- 6 tertiary concepts (background knowledge)

**Relationship Types:**
- Causal (language drift → architectural drift)
- Enabling (agentic systems → continuous capture)
- Constraining (cognitive load → vocabulary size)
- Tension (guidance ↔ autonomy)

## Key Research Insights

### 1. Economic Feasibility Shift
Agentic systems change economics: point-in-time glossaries → continuous linguistic monitoring becomes operationally feasible.

### 2. Bounded Contexts as Linguistic Governance
Different contexts legitimately use same words differently. Translation required at boundaries, not global unification.

### 3. "Human in Charge" as Design Constraint
Different from "human in the loop." Humans own accountability, authority, veto rights. Agents observe and evidence; humans interpret and decide.

### 4. Six Major Failure Modes Identified
Linguistic policing, false positives, power instrument, incentive conflicts, canonizing wrong model, maintenance burden. All have documented mitigations.

### 5. Language as Leading Indicator
Linguistic conflicts precede architectural problems by 2-4 weeks (historical). Target: detect <2 weeks with agentic monitoring.

## Decision Points

### Proceed to Phase 1? (Research Cycle)
If yes:
1. Select 3-5 priority sources from reading list
2. Extract concept inventory (terms, definitions, relationships)
3. Draft focused primer on one core concept
4. Validate with domain experts
5. Iterate based on feedback

### Proceed to Phase 2? (Pilot)
If yes:
1. Select bounded context for pilot
2. Bootstrap glossary manually (20-30 terms)
3. Configure tooling (Contextive, PR review agent)
4. Run first observation cycle (1-2 weeks)
5. Measure baseline (conflict lead time, glossary usage, sentiment)

### Do Not Proceed?
If experiment deemed not viable:
- Document rationale (failed experiments stay visible)
- Capture reusable insights
- Archive materials for future reference
