# Documentation

Purpose: Entry point for all repository documentation (architecture, templates, how-to guides, audience profiles, planning, reports, style guides).

What belongs: Authoritative docs, templates, and guides referenced by contributors and agents.  
What doesn’t: Temporary notes or private working drafts (use `work/`).
