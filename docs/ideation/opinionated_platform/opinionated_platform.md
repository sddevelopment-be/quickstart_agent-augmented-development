# Opinionated Agentic Platform

The core idea is to provide users with a set of defaults ( directives, guidelines, etc. ) that are designed to help them achieve their goals more efficiently and effectively. In order to do this, we need to enhance the existing framework with a set of opinionated features that will guide users in the right direction.

## Agent Directives

The existing directives are captured in `/agents/directives/` , `agents/approaches` and `agents/guidelines`. These serve as the basis for the agentic framework, and agent behaviour.

## User Choices

Users can choose to edit / disable / remove these directives, or add their own. However, by default, the platform will provide a set of opinionated directives that are designed to help users achieve their goals more effectively.
