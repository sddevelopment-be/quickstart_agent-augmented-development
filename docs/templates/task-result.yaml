# Task Result Template
# Version: 1.0.0
#
# This template documents the result object that agents add upon successful task completion.
# This is added BY THE AGENT, not by the task creator.

# ============================================================================
# RESULT OBJECT (Added by agent on successful completion)
# ============================================================================

result:
  # Brief description of work completed
  summary: "Description of what was accomplished"
  
  # Actual artifacts created or modified
  artefacts:
    - "path/to/created/artifact1.md"
    - "path/to/modified/artifact2.md"
  
  # Optional: Agent to hand off to for follow-up work
  next_agent: "next-agent-name"
  
  # Optional: Title for follow-up task
  next_task_title: "Follow-up task description"
  
  # Optional: Artifacts for follow-up task
  next_artefacts:
    - "path/to/artifact.md"
  
  # Optional: Context notes for follow-up task

  # Completion timestamp
  completed_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"

# ============================================================================
# USAGE
# ============================================================================
#
# DO NOT include result block when creating a task.
# The assigned agent adds this block when completing the task.
#
# Agent workflow:
# 1. Agent reads task from work/assigned/<agent-name>/
# 2. Agent updates status to "in_progress"
# 3. Agent performs work and creates/modifies artifacts
# 4. Agent adds result block to task YAML
# 5. Agent updates status to "done"
# 6. Agent moves task to work/done/
#
# If next_agent is specified, the Agent Orchestrator will:
# - Create a new task in work/inbox/ for the specified agent
# - Copy next_task_title, next_artefacts, next_task_notes to new task
# - Add dependency reference to original task
#
# Example result block:
#   result:
#     summary: "Generated REPO_MAP and SURFACES"
#     artefacts:
#       - "docs/REPO_MAP.md"
#       - "docs/SURFACES.md"
#     next_agent: "lexical"
#     next_task_title: "Perform voice analysis on structural docs"
#     next_artefacts:
#       - "docs/REPO_MAP.md"
#       - "docs/SURFACES.md"
#     next_task_notes:
#       - "Check for consistent terminology"
#     completed_at: "2025-11-23T14:45:00Z"
