# Task Timestamps Template
# Version: 1.0.0
#
# This template documents timestamp fields that are auto-populated by the system.
# These fields track task lifecycle progression.

# Populated by: Human or planning agent

# Creator identifier (human username or agent name)
# Populated by: Human or planning agent
created_by: "username or agent"

# ISO 8601 timestamp when task was assigned
# Populated by: Agent Orchestrator
assigned_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"

# ISO 8601 timestamp when agent started work
# Populated by: Assigned agent
started_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"

# ISO 8601 timestamp when task was completed

# ============================================================================
# USAGE
# ============================================================================
#
# When creating a task:
# - Set created_at to current UTC time
# - Set created_by to your username or "agent-name"
# - Leave other timestamps blank (commented out or omitted)
#
# The system will populate remaining timestamps as the task progresses:
# - assigned_at: When orchestrator moves task to work/assigned/<agent>/
# - started_at: When agent updates status to "in_progress"
# - completed_at: When agent updates status to "done"
#
# Example initial task:
#   id: "2025-11-23T1430-structural-repomap"
#   agent: "structural"
#   status: "new"
#   artefacts: ["docs/REPO_MAP.md"]
#   created_at: "2025-11-23T14:30:00Z"
#   created_by: "stijn"
#
# See: docs/templates/task-base.yaml for required fields
