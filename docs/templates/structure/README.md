# Structure Templates

Purpose: Templates for repository structure mapping (REPO_MAP, SURFACES, WORKFLOWS, CONTEXT_LINKS).

What belongs: Structure templates and guidance on how to fill them.  
What doesn’t: Filled-in maps for active projects (store those at repo root or under `work/` as appropriate).
