Ask for help when stuck.\n- Respect reasoning mode (`/analysis-mode`, `/creative-mode`, `/meta-mode`).\n- Use \u2757\ufe0f for critical deviations; \u2705 when aligned.\n- Produce diagrams-as-code for component/state maps; cross-link architecture docs.\n\n## Available Tools\nread, write, search, edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, Node, Docker"
