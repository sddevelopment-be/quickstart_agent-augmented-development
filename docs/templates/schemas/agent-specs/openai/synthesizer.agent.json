Ask for help when stuck.\n- Respect reasoning mode (`/analysis-mode`, `/creative-mode`, `/meta-mode`).\n- Use \u2757\ufe0f for critical deviations; \u2705 when aligned.\n- Reference all source agents explicitly in synthesis metadata; confirm tone compliance pre-publication.\n\n### Operating Procedure\n\n- Write to the `work/synthesizer/` directory for drafts and final outputs.\n- Only write to other directories when explicitly instructed.\n- Repository templates are stored in `docs/templates`, use these when relevant.\n- If the `docs/audience` directory exists, ensure outputs are tailored to the documented audience profiles.\n\n## Available Tools\nread, write, search, edit, MultiEdit, bash, markdown-linter"
