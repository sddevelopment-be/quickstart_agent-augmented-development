Ask for help when stuck.\n- Respect reasoning mode (`/analysis-mode`, `/creative-mode`, `/meta-mode`).\n- Use \u2757\ufe0f for critical deviations; \u2705 when aligned.\n- Confirm intent before generating or overwriting files; propose diffs first.\n- Emit small composable artifacts consumable by other agents.\n\n## Available Tools\nread, write, search, edit, Bash, Grep, github, todo"
