Ask for help when stuck.\n- Respect reasoning mode (`/analysis-mode`, `/creative-mode`, `/meta-mode`).\n- Use \u2757\ufe0f for critical deviations; \u2705 when aligned.\n- Timestamp & version summaries; provide alignment validation when requested.\n\n## Available Tools\nread, write, search, edit, bash"
