# ShellCheck Configuration
# Project: Agent-Augmented Development Framework
# Purpose: Configure static analysis for 22 shell scripts in the project
# Reference: Directive 001 (CLI & Shell Tooling)

# This is not optional and must be followed in all scripts

# Disable checks that are intentionally excluded for this project:
# SC1091: "Not following sourced file" - Project uses dynamic sourcing patterns
# SC2086: "Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting" - Project allows controlled expansion
# SC2181: "Check exit code directly with success/failure of last command" - Common pattern
disable=SC1091,SC2086,SC2181

# Output format: gcc - compatible with CI/CD systems and IDE integration
