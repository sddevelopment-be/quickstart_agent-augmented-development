# ShellCheck Configuration
# Project: Agent-Augmented Development Framework
# Purpose: Configure static analysis for 22 shell scripts in the project
# Reference: Directive 001 (CLI & Shell Tooling)

# Enable all optional checks - catches style issues, potential bugs, and unsafe patterns
enable=all

# ENFORCED: SC2250 - Variable bracing is mandatory (${VAR} not $VAR)
# This is not optional and must be followed in all scripts
# See: doctrine/docs/styleguides/shell-scripts.md

# Disable checks that are intentionally excluded for this project:
# SC1091: "Not following sourced file" - Project uses dynamic sourcing patterns
# SC2086: "Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting" - Project allows controlled expansion
# SC2181: "Check exit code directly with success/failure of last command" - Common pattern
# SC2317: "Command appears unreachable" - False positives for indirectly called functions
# SC2310: "Function invoked in || condition" - Intentional pattern for error handling
# SC2311: "set -e disabled in command substitution" - Acceptable for capturing command output
# SC2312: "Command substitution in echo/test" - Acceptable for simple display/test operations
# SC2016: "Expressions don't expand in single quotes" - Intentional for literal strings
disable=SC1091,SC2086,SC2181,SC2317,SC2310,SC2311,SC2312,SC2016
