# Initiative: Conceptual Alignment

**Status:** Proposed  
**Priority:** High  
**Owner:** Analyst Annie  
**Created:** 2026-02-10

## Overview

Establish comprehensive terminology alignment across the repository by creating a living glossary system that integrates ubiquitous language experiment research with existing doctrine framework terminology.

## Goals

1. **Unified glossary** combining framework + domain terms
2. **Contextive IDE integration** for inline terminology
3. **Visual concept mapping** showing relationships
4. **Advisory PR-level terminology validation**

## Key Tasks

### MUST HAVE (Phase 1 - Core Functionality)
- Expand doctrine/GLOSSARY.md with 40+ DDD terms
- Integrate experiment terminology into Contextive glossaries
- Add organizational patterns (Conway's Law, Team Topologies)
- Add practice terms (Event Storming, Responsibility-Driven Design)
- Add anti-pattern terms (Dictionary DDD, Anemic Domain Model, etc.)

### SHOULD HAVE (Phase 2 - Integration)
- Populate Contextive definitions for all bounded contexts
- Create Contextive setup guide in docs/
- Validate glossary structure with stakeholders

### COULD HAVE (Phase 3 - Visualization)
- Generate concept map (simplified from experiment)
- Create concept map usage guide
- Audit specifications for terminology alignment

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 50-70 core terms in unified glossary
- ✅ Contextive glossaries organized by bounded context (one file per context)
- ✅ Concept map with 5+ relationship types
- ✅ Zero unresolved term conflicts
- ✅ >80% of specifications reference glossary terms

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Glossary expansion and Contextive structure  
**Week 2:** Integration and documentation  
**Week 3:** Validation and handoff
