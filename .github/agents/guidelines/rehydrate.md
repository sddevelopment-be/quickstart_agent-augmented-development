How an agent should resume work from existing context.

1. Look for recent context in `work/`:
   - Progress logs
   - Notes related to your specialist role
   - Any TODO lists

2. Skim:
   - `docs/VISION.md` (to refresh purpose)
   - `docs/specific_guidelines.md` (for constraints)
   - Your own specialist file

3. Summarise:
   - What appears to have been done last.
   - What is still open.

4. Append to the relevant progress log in `work/`:
   - What you are about to do.
   - Any assumptions you’re making.

5. Do a small, incremental unit of work, then summarise again.
