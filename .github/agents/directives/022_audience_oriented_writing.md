# 021 Audience Oriented Writing Directive

**Purpose:** Ensure every written artifact explicitly targets the correct reader persona, leveraging the “Target-Audience Fit” approach and the curated personas under `docs/audience/`.

## Requirements

1. **Identify Personas**  
   - Before drafting, list the persona(s) from `docs/audience/` you intend to serve.  
   - If no persona fits, create a temporary note in `work/notes/external_memory/` and alert the Curator for follow-up.

2. **Load Context Efficiently**  
   - Use Directive 002 (Token Discipline) to keep global guardrails loaded while swapping persona specifics in/out as needed.  
   - Reference `work/notes/ideation/opinionated_platform/target_audience_personas.md` for the overarching rationale.

3. **Apply the Approach**  
   - Follow the steps in `agents/approaches/target-audience-fit.md`: identify reader groups, adapt tone/depth, and split documents when divergence is too high.  
   - Signpost sections for multi-persona documents (“For Jordan – Getting Started”).

4. **Document Alignment**  
   - In summaries/work logs, state which personas were addressed and how.  
   - Capture persona feedback or deviations in `work/notes/external_memory/` (or relevant logs) so personas remain living documents.

5. **Validation**  
   - Reject drafts that lack a clear persona framing or that mix conflicting tones without signposting.  
   - Escalate with ⚠️ or ❗️ if persona guidance conflicts or is outdated.
