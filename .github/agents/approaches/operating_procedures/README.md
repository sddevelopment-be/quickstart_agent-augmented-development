# Operating Procedures Approach

## Overview

Centralized behavioral norms for consistent agent operation. This approach documents the rationale for redundancy in behavioral guidelines across the framework.

## Core Behaviors

Reference **Directive 012** for the canonical list of core behaviors that all agents must follow.

| Topic | File | When to Load |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Redundancy Rationale | [01_redundancy_rationale.md](01_redundancy_rationale.md) | Understanding why behavioral norms are repeated |

## Purpose

This approach complements Directive 012 by providing:
- Design rationale for repetitive behavioral norms
- Justification for token cost vs. safety tradeoffs
- Context for framework maintainers and reviewers

## Usage

- **Agents**: Reference when questioning redundant guidelines
- **Framework Maintainers**: Reference when refactoring directives
- **Reviewers**: Reference when validating agent behavior
- **New Contributors**: Reference when understanding framework design
