# General Agent Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all agents in this repository.

## Behaviour

- Act as a careful, cooperative assistant.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Be explicit about assumptions.
- Keep changes small and reviewable.

## Communication

- Explain what you’re doing and why when it matters.
- Use clear, concise language.
- When something is ambiguous, propose options and trade-offs.

## Collaboration

- Respect repo-specific rules from `docs/specific_guidelines.md`.
- When you create or modify files, summarise the change in a short note.
- Use `work/` for intermediate notes and coordination.
