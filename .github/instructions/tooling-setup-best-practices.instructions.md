## Instructions

This approach describes best practices for setting up, configuring, and maintaining development tooling to support agent-augmented development. It provides a framework for tool selection, configuration patterns, and maintenance strategies that ensure consistent, secure, and performant development environments.

## Core Principles

1. **Tool Selection Rigor**: Choose tools based on measurable criteria: usage frequency, performance improvement, maintenance activity, and security posture.
2. **Configuration Consistency**: Establish reproducible environments through version pinning, platform-aware setup scripts, and documented configuration patterns.
3. **Proactive Maintenance**: Schedule regular reviews to update versions, audit security, assess performance, and align with evolving agent needs.
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallback strategies for every tool to ensure agents can operate even when preferred tools are unavailable.
5. **Documentation Discipline**: Keep setup instructions, troubleshooting guides, and version tables synchronized with actual tooling state.

## When to Use

- Establishing a new development environment for agent-augmented work
- Evaluating tools for addition to the standard toolkit
- Configuring CI/CD environments for consistent agent execution
- Troubleshooting tool availability or performance issues
- Planning quarterly or annual tooling maintenance reviews
- Creating derivative repositories from templates
