## Instructions

Provide a single, precise reference for the file-based asynchronous orchestration model that powers the
`work/` directory. The approach keeps exploratory and operational work visible inside Git by representing every task as a YAML file that flows through clearly defined directories and lifecycle states. Humans, agents, and automation can collaborate without bespoke services while preserving a full audit trail.

## Example Prompts

- "How do I set up task-based agent coordination?"
- "Explain the file-based orchestration workflow"
- "Explain the Work Directory Orchestration Approach approach"
- "When should I use Work Directory Orchestration Approach?"
