## Instructions

The Test Readability and Clarity Check is a dual-agent validation approach that assesses whether a test suite effectively documents system behavior by reconstructing system understanding purely from test code. This approach validates that tests serve as executable specifications and identifies gaps in architectural context documentation.

**Key Insight:
** Tests that allow accurate system reconstruction without external documentation prove their quality as living specification documents.

## Core Principles

1. **Test-as-Documentation**: Tests should comprehensively document system behavior so that reading tests alone enables understanding of what the system does.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Isolate behavioral documentation (what/how) from architectural rationale (why) to identify documentation gaps systematically.
3. **Dual Perspective**: Combine naive analysis (tests-only) with expert review (full context) to quantify test documentation quality.
4. **Measurable Outcomes**: Generate accuracy metrics to track test quality improvements over time and justify test investment.
5. **Actionable Feedback**: Produce specific recommendations for enhancing test suite documentation value. ---

## When to Use

- Major test suite refactoring completed (validate improvement)
- New team members onboarding (generate system overview)
- Architecture documentation audit needed (find alignment gaps)
- Quality gate before major release (comprehensive validation)
- Quarterly quality reviews (track test suite evolution)

## Example Prompts

- "Guide me through test-driven development"
- "How should I structure my tests?"
- "Explain the Test Readability and Clarity Check Approach approach"
- "When should I use Test Readability and Clarity Check Approach?"
