  # Housekeeping and Refactoring Epic

  ## Overview

  This epic tracks ongoing housekeeping and refactoring work to improve the agent framework's maintainability, token efficiency, and developer experience.

  ## Context

  Following the work directory restructuring, several follow-up tasks were identified to:
  1. Reduce token consumption in verbose directives
  2. Improve consistency across agent documentation
  3. Enhance observability and monitoring capabilities
  4. Assess future improvements to the orchestration system

  ## Goals

  - **Token Efficiency**: Extract verbose directive content into modular approaches/templates
  - **Consistency**: Create shared glossaries and improve cross-references
  - **Observability**: Implement metric capture and dashboard capabilities
  - **Future Planning**: Assess architectural improvements

  ## Scope

  This epic includes refactoring existing directives, creating supporting infrastructure, and architectural assessments. It does NOT include new feature development.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] All verbose directives refactored with 50%+ token reduction
  - [ ] Shared glossary created and integrated
  - [ ] Metric capture scripts operational
  - [ ] Dashboard files automatically generated
  - [ ] Architectural assessments documented as ADRs

  ## Related Work

  - Work directory restructuring PR
  - Directive 019 refactoring (completed as template, commit 4c648e4)

  ## Timeline

  **Target:** Complete within 2-3 weeks  
  **Priority:** High (technical debt reduction)

  ## Child Issues

  Will be created and linked below.
