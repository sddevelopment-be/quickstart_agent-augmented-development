  # POC3 Multi-Agent Chain Validation Epic

  ## Overview

  Final validation proof-of-concept before declaring the orchestration system production-ready. Tests complete multi-agent chain with handoffs, metrics, and documentation.

  ## Context

  - Created: 2025-11-23
  - Purpose: Validate multi-agent collaboration and handoff patterns
  - Chain: Architect → Diagrammer → Synthesizer → Writer-Editor → Curator
  - Status: Partially complete, follow-up tasks remain

  ## Goals

  - **Validate Handoffs**: Ensure seamless agent-to-agent task transitions
  - **Test Metrics**: Verify ADR-009 metrics capture throughout chain
  - **Documentation**: Complete documentation and accessibility updates
  - **Quality Gates**: Curator final validation before production declaration

  ## Scope

  Includes diagram updates, documentation synthesis, and final validation tasks from the POC3 chain.

  ## Success Criteria

  - [ ] All POC3 follow-up tasks completed
  - [ ] Diagrams updated with metrics visualization
  - [ ] Documentation synthesized and reviewed
  - [ ] Curator validation passed
  - [ ] Metrics captured at each step
  - [ ] Handoff pattern validated

  ## Timeline

  **Target:** 1 week  
  **Priority:** High (final validation before production)
