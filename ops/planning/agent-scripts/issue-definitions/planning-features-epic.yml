    # Feature: Distribution & Release Enablement

    ## Objective
    Deliver the release artifact (+ scripts + Guardian workflow) defined in ADR-013 and ADR-014 so downstream repos can adopt the framework via a single, auditable package.

    ## Context
    - ADR-019 commits us to trunk-based releases, ADR-020 formalizes the runtime layers, and ADR-021 drives router diversity. None of that matters if we cannot safely ship `quickstart-framework-<version>.zip`.
    - Architecture + technical designs live under `docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_*.md`; the architect work log (`work/reports/logs/architect/2025-11-24T2105-distribution-release-architecture.md`) enumerates deliverables still pending implementation.

    ## Current Signals
    - No tasks currently cover packaging automation, install/upgrade scripts, or Framework Guardian execution.
    - Release-readiness is a gating constraint for downstream rollout and the “Distribution / Release” surface called out in `docs/architecture/design/README.md`.

    ## Execution Framework
    - Follow `.github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/README.md` for every spawned task.
    - Coordinate large batches through `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` so Guardian + packaging work stays auditable.

    ## Scope
    - Build CI-friendly pipeline to assemble the zip + META files.
    - Implement `framework_install.sh` and `framework_upgrade.sh` with the conflict-handling logic described in the technical design.
    - Materialize the Framework Guardian agent profile + templates in `.github/agents/`.
    - Document end-to-end release/upgrade steps inside `docs/HOW_TO_USE/` and `docs/architecture/design/`.

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - ✅ Releases emit the documented directory structure with manifest + metadata checksums.
    - ✅ Framework Guardian produces `FRAMEWORK_AUDIT_REPORT.md` and `FRAMEWORK_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` from the provided templates.
    - ✅ Release notes describe ADR coverage and include Guardian invocation instructions.
    - ✅ Dry-run and conflict workflows are validated (tests and at least one rehearsal task).

    ## Dependencies
    - `docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_architecture.md`
    - `docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_technical_design.md`
    - ADR-013, ADR-014, ADR-020, ADR-021

    ## Follow-up Tasks to Generate
    - Packaging pipeline implementation task
    - Installer/upgrade script development + tests
    - Framework Guardian agent + templates + validation tasks
    - Release notes / publishing checklist task

    # Feature: Toolchain Governance & Lifecycle

    ## Objective
    Turn the Copilot tooling assessment into hardening steps (policy, automation, documentation) so Layer 0 utilities stay secure, observable, and easy to roll forward.

    ## Context
    - Trunk-based development (ADR-019) amplifies the need for predictable developer environments.
    - Tool versions, security posture, and telemetry drive the “quality-to-cost” lens from ADR-021 and ADR-012.

    ## Current Signals
    - Manager, architect, curator, and build-automation tasks remain open and uncoordinated.
    - Setup script changes stalled pending checksum verification and version policy.

    ## Execution Framework
    - Manage work through `.github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/`.
    - Bundle batches via `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` whenever multiple tooling tasks are advanced together.

    ## Scope
    - Define update cadence + rollback policy (architect).
    - Implement checksum verification, parallel installs, and opt-in telemetry (build automation).
    - Publish tooling best practices and maintenance checklists (curator).
    - Keep the coordination status board updated (manager).

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - ✅ Version policy published and referenced by CONTRIBUTING/HOW_TO_USE.
    - ✅ `.github/copilot/setup.sh` validates checksums and installs tools concurrently without regressions.
    - ✅ Telemetry can be toggled on/off, stores local metrics, and respects privacy constraints.
    - ✅ Best-practice guide + maintenance checklists merged under `.github/agents/approaches/` and `docs/templates/checklists/`.
    - ✅ Coordination doc (`work/planning/tooling-enhancements-roadmap.md`) reflects dependencies + state.

    # Feature: Collaboration Infrastructure Hardening

    ## Objective
    Stabilize the recent script relocation (into `ops/` + `validation/`), ensure workflows point to the right modules, and add maintenance automation (manifest + archival) so file-based orchestration stays healthy.

    ## Context
    - Script reorg PR (`copilot/rework-automation-scripts`) moved orchestration assets, but validation/documentation/automation follow-ups remain.
    - New backlog items (manifest maintenance, work-item cleanup) eliminate manual toil inside `work/collaboration/`.

    ## Execution Framework
    - Process each task under `.github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/`.
    - When batching (e.g., running regression tests + doc updates), mirror the cadence described in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md`.

    ## Scope
    - Validate script structure + task utilities (curator task).
    - Update affected docs (writer-editor task).
    - Test CI workflows for new paths (build automation task).
    - Add directives manifest upkeep script.
    - Add cleanup/archival scripts for done/archive directories.

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - ✅ Script reorg validated, duplicates removed, and references cleaned up.
    - ✅ HOW_TO_USE + CONTRIBUTING references updated with new paths.
    - ✅ `.github/workflows/validation.yml` and `orchestration.yml` green with new composite action.
    - ✅ `ops/scripts/maintenance/update_directives_manifest.py` (plus tests + README) in place with dry-run/fix flags.
    - ✅ Archive/compression automation available with configurable ages + logging.

    # Feature: Insight & Efficiency Reporting

    ## Objective
    Keep stakeholder-facing narratives (POC3 synthesis) and architecture-facing efficiency trendlines current so prioritization decisions remain evidence-based.

    ## Context
    - POC3 follow-up report needs a clarity pass before stakeholders can rely on it.
    - ADR-012 and ADR-021 depend on accurate quality-to-cost telemetry, which the architect assessment must deliver.

    ## Execution Framework
    - Use `.github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/` for all edits/logs.
    - When iterating on documents and assessments in a single session, follow `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` to keep task logs + AGENT_STATUS updates consistent.

    ## Scope
    - Writer-editor clarity review of `work/reports/synthesizer/2025-11-27T1911-poc3-followup-aggregate-synthesis.md`.
    - Architect efficiency assessment using synthesizer metrics + logs.
    - Ensure recommendations/prioritization feed back into planning docs.

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - ✅ POC3 synthesis trimmed for clarity without losing quantitative fidelity; editorial notes captured for curator.
    - ✅ Efficiency assessment logged + cross-referenced inside ADR-012 with recommended adjustments.
    - ✅ Outcomes reflected in `docs/planning/FEATURES_OVERVIEW.md` and future batches.

    # Feature: Multi-Tier Platform Enablement

    ## Objective
    Execute the Platform Next Steps assessment so router configs, orchestration
    interfaces, local worker automation, diagrams, and CI guardrails exist for
    the four-tier runtime outlined in ADR-020 and ADR-021.

    ## Context
    - Assessment: docs/architecture/assessments/platform_next_steps.md
    - ADRs: 002 (portability), 009 (metrics), 020 (multi-tier runtime), 021 (model routing)
    - Brainstorm inputs: work/notes/ideation/full_automatic_agents/brainstorm_part*.md

    ## Current Signals
    - No backlog items previously covered router config, local worker automation,
      or diagram/CI updates required by Alphonso’s plan.
    - Distribution/Release work depends on these assets to be production-ready.

    ## Execution Framework
    - Use `.github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/` for every task,
      logging results per Directive 014.
    - Bundle batches through `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` when
      multiple artifacts (config + CI) are touched together.

    ## Scope
    - Create model router config + validator.
    - Draft router-agnostic model_client interface.
    - Extend task descriptors/directives with model selection hints.
    - Operationalize Ollama worker config + runner.
    - Produce diagrams for Layers 0-3.
    - Integrate router and task-schema validators into CI.

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - ✅ Router config validated and version-controlled with fallback rules.
    - ✅ model_client interface documented and ready for integration.
    - ✅ Template + directive updates merged; tasks start including model hints.
    - ✅ Local worker script + config demoed in work log.
    - ✅ Architecture diagrams rendered and referenced in docs/ADRs.
    - ✅ CI fails fast when router config or task schema drifts.

    # Feature: Orchestration Iteration Enablement

    ## Objective
    Provide a dedicated GitHub issue scaffold (plus documentation hooks) for
    running orchestration cycles so Manager Mike, Curator Claire, and future
    automation can initialize iterations without missing required metadata.

    ## Context
    - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` defines the managerial workflow
      but lacks a tailored issue type entry point.
    - `docs/architecture/async_orchestration_technical_design.md` and
      `work/collaboration/AGENT_STATUS.md` require consistent metadata to
      describe iteration state changes.

    ## Current Signals
    - Task `2025-11-23T2134-curator-add-github-issue-type-for-orch-task.yml`
      remains in the inbox without a framing feature.
    - New agents and downstream repos need the same orchestration template
      to stay aligned with ADR-008 (file-based async coordination).

    ## Execution Framework
    - Follow `.github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/` for task
      lifecycle updates and logging.
    - Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` as the base specification
      while curating documentation updates in `docs/HOW_TO_USE/`.

    ## Scope
    - Draft the GitHub issue template entry for orchestration cycles (title,
      labels, metadata, configuration parameters).
    - Cross-link the template to AGENT_STATUS instructions and orchestration
      design docs.
    - Document how new iterations should be created, validated, and logged.
    - Capture success metrics and logging expectations per Directive 014.

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - ✅ New GitHub issue template stored under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and
      referenced from orchestration docs.
    - ✅ AGENT_STATUS and work/collaboration guides mention the iteration issue
      type plus required metadata.
    - ✅ Validation scripts (template checker) cover the new template in CI.
    - ✅ Work log recorded with follow-up actions or links to Manager Mike runs.
