    Curator focus areas:
    1. Governance validation (refined docs still comply with ADR standards)
    2. Consistency audit (terminology standardization complete)
    3. Quality assurance (clarity improvements introduced no inaccuracies)
    4. Chain completeness (POC3 deliverables meet success criteria)
    
    Open questions:
    - Should DESCRIPTIONS.md gain navigation guide/TOC?
    - Are POC3 metrics practices ready for broader adoption?
    - Does ADR-009 need formal acceptance confirmation?
