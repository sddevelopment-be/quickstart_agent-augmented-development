context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  notes:
  - "Chain position: 3/5 (Architect \u2192 Diagrammer \u2192 **Synthesizer** \u2192\
    \ Writer-Editor \u2192 Curator)"
  - 'Primary goal: Aggregate ADR-009 standard with diagram visualizations'
  - Create synthesis document linking ADR-009 concepts to diagram implementations
  - Verify cross-artifact consistency between ADR-009 and updated diagrams
  - Validate metrics capture points shown in metrics-dashboard-concept.puml match
    ADR-009 spec
  - 'Reference: docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-009-orchestration-metrics-standard.md'
  - 'Reference: docs/architecture/diagrams/workflow-sequential-flow.puml (updated
    with metrics)'
  - 'Reference: docs/architecture/diagrams/metrics-dashboard-concept.puml (new)'
  - 'Reference: docs/architecture/diagrams/DESCRIPTIONS.md (updated accessibility)'
  - Follow ADR-009 standards (metrics block, per-artifact validation, tiered logging)
dependencies:
- 2025-11-23T1738-architect-poc3-multi-agent-chain
- 2025-11-23T2100-diagrammer-poc3-diagram-updates
success_criteria:
- "Synthesis document created showing ADR-009 \u2192 diagram mappings"
- Cross-artifact linkage verified (no inconsistencies detected)
- Metrics capture points in diagram match ADR-009 specification
- Accessibility descriptions validated for completeness
- Metrics block included in task result (per ADR-009)
- Per-artifact integrity markers in work log
- Work log follows tiered structure (Core tier minimum)
deliverables:
- Synthesis document aggregating ADR-009 + diagrams
- Cross-artifact consistency validation report
- Handoff notes for writer-editor (clarity improvements)
