title: Create 'Locality of Change / Avoid Gold Plating' Directive
description: 'Capture architectural lessons and process improvements from ADR-011
  analysis

  into a new directive that guides agents to avoid premature optimization and

  gold plating. Focus on principles: measure problem severity before designing

  solutions, preserve core principles, and favor simple alternatives.

  notes:
  - Extract key lessons from ADR-011 architectural assessment
  - Focus on 'don't add complexity to solve problems that don't exist'
  - Include 'measure problem severity before designing solutions'
  - Emphasize 'simple alternatives often achieve 80% of benefits at 20% of cost'
  - Pattern analysis should always precede pattern prescription
  - Include 'do nothing' as baseline option in trade-off deliberation
  - Document decisions in work log per Directive 014
  - Assign to relevant agents (architect, build-automation, curator)

result:
  summary: Created Directive 016 (Locality of Change / Avoiding Gold Plating) capturing
    architectural lessons from ADR-011 analysis. Directive provides actionable guidance
    on avoiding premature optimization through problem measurement, simple alternatives,
    and principle preservation. Includes decision framework, anti-patterns, agent-specific
    application guidance, and integration with existing directives.
