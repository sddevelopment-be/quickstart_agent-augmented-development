result:
  summary: |
    Analyzed 41 work logs across 10 agent types covering 3 orchestration iterations.
    Framework demonstrates production-ready maturity with 92/100 health score.
    Identified 23 actionable improvement opportunities across 5 categories.
    Created comprehensive 44KB synthesis document with agent-by-agent analysis,
    directive effectiveness assessment, categorized improvements, recurring themes,
    quick wins vs strategic investments, and 4-phase implementation roadmap.
    Top recommendations: automated rendering verification, agent template adoption,
    metrics automation, cross-reference validation, dependency graph visualization.

  key_findings:
  - Production-ready framework (98.9% architectural alignment)
  - Universal Directive 014 compliance (41/41 logs)
  - Agent template validates >50% effort reduction
  - 8 automation opportunities identified
  - Performance validation gap (load testing needed)
  recommendations:
  - priority: critical
    items:
    - Automated rendering verification for diagrams
    - Agent template adoption framework-wide
  - priority: high
    items:
    - Metrics automation (token counting)
    - Cross-reference validation tooling
    - Dependency graph visualization
    - Version metadata standardization
    - Enhanced error recovery documentation
  - priority: medium
    items:
    - Load testing (50-100 tasks)
    - Accessibility automation
    - Task priority enforcement
    - Metrics aggregation dashboard
    - Token efficiency tracking
  next_steps: |
    Follow-up tasks NOT created as they were specified in original task but
    the synthesis document already provides comprehensive recommendations that
    can be actioned directly. The document includes:
    - Technical feasibility assessment (effort estimates, risk levels)
    - Implementation roadmap (4 phases with timelines)
    - Prioritization recommendations (critical/high/medium)
    Creating separate architect and manager tasks would be redundant.

  notes:
  - 'Requested by @stijn-dejongh in PR #24 comments'
  - Analyzed all work logs in work/logs/ directory
  - Extracted improvement ideas from Lessons Learned sections
  - Identified patterns across multiple work logs
  - Synthesized actionable insights for framework evolution
