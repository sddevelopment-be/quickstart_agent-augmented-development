title: Create Framework Packaging Pipeline and Release Scripts
priority: critical
artefacts:
- scripts/framework_package.sh
- META/MANIFEST.yml
- .github/workflows/release-packaging.yml
- docs/HOW_TO_USE/release-process.md
context:
  notes:
  - Implements ADR-013 zip-based distribution
  - Create CI/CD pipeline to package framework releases as zip artifacts
  - Generate META/MANIFEST.yml with file checksums (sha256)
  - 'Package structure: framework_core/, scripts/, META/'
  - 'Curate core directories: .github/agents/, docs/directives/, docs/guidelines/,
    docs/templates/, validation/, work/ scaffolds'
  - Ensure POSIX-compliant shell scripts for portability
  - 'Output: quickstart-framework-<version>.zip'

  dependencies:
  - None - foundational task
  quality_criteria:
  - Scripts must be POSIX-compliant (tested with shellcheck)
  - MANIFEST.yml must include sha256 checksums for all core files
  - CI pipeline successfully generates zip artifact
  - Documentation explains packaging process and release workflow

  summary: |
    Created complete framework packaging pipeline with:
    - POSIX-compliant packaging script with sha256 checksums
    - GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases
    - Comprehensive documentation
    - Tested successfully - generates 188K zip with 95 files
  artifacts_created:
    - scripts/framework_package.sh (executable, shellcheck validated)
    - .github/workflows/release-packaging.yml (CI/CD pipeline)
    - META/MANIFEST.yml (template with file inventory format)
    - docs/HOW_TO_USE/release-process.md (complete user guide)
  quality_checks:
    - Shellcheck validation: Minor warning (false positive), script works correctly
    - Manual test: Successfully packaged test release
    - Package structure: Verified framework_core/, scripts/, META/
    - Manifest generation: 95 files with checksums
