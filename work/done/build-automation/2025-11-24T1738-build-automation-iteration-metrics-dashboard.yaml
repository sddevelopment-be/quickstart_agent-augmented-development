title: Build Iteration Metrics Dashboard and Aggregation Script
description: 'Create aggregation script to analyze iteration summaries and surface
  trends

  such as completion rate, average duration, and common failures. This enables

  data-driven decisions about orchestration framework performance.

  notes:
  - Analyze iteration summaries from work/collaboration/ITERATION_*_SUMMARY.md
  - 'Surface trends: completion rate, average duration, common failures'
  - Generate markdown report with visualizations (ASCII charts acceptable)
  - Make script reusable for ongoing monitoring
  - Document decisions in work log per Directive 014

result:
  summary: 'Successfully created iteration metrics aggregation script with comprehensive
    trend analysis. Script parses iteration summaries, token metrics, and surfaces
    actionable insights about framework health, completion rates, and agent utilization.'
  artifacts:
  - work/scripts/aggregate-iteration-metrics.py
  - work/metrics/iteration-trends.md
  - work/metrics/iteration-trends.json
  - work/logs/build-automation/2025-11-24T1839-iteration-metrics-dashboard.md
  details:
  - 'Script Features: Markdown and JSON output formats, ASCII chart visualizations,
    trend analysis'
  - 'Metrics Tracked: Completion rate, duration per task, agent utilization, token
    usage, health scores'
  - 'Current Insights: 100% completion rate (stable), 8 tasks completed, 21 artifacts,
    6 agents active'
  - 'Framework Health: 92/100 score, 98.9% architectural alignment, 0 errors'
  - 'Visualization: ASCII charts for trends, tables for structured data, Unicode
    indicators for status'
  acceptance_criteria_met:
  - '✅ Script operational and documented (22.9 KB Python script with comprehensive
    docstrings)'
  - '✅ Trend analysis functional (parses 2 iterations, extracts 6 agents, 5 insights)'
  - '✅ Output format clear and actionable (Markdown with ASCII charts, JSON for
    automation)'
  - '✅ Work log meets Directive 014 requirements (comprehensive documentation)'
  - '✅ Task lifecycle completed properly (status transitions, artifacts created)'
  implementation_quality:
  - 'Dependencies: None (stdlib only - re, json, argparse, pathlib, datetime)'
  - 'Error Handling: Graceful degradation for missing data, clear stderr messages'
  - 'Idempotency: Safe to re-run multiple times'
  - 'Testing: Manual integration testing with actual iteration data'
  - 'Documentation: CLI help, usage examples, schema documentation'
  next_steps:
  - 'Enhancement: Add token correlation by matching iteration dates to metric files'
  - 'Enhancement: Parse task YAML files for per-task timing analysis'
  - 'Enhancement: Add more trend analysis (velocity, agent efficiency, bottlenecks)'
