    - "task-lifecycle-state-machine.puml already existed - high quality, reused"
    - "Created 4 new sequence diagrams for workflow patterns"
    - "Created 1 Gantt chart for implementation timeline"
    - "Updated source documents with cross-references to diagrams"
    - "Maintained consistent color scheme with existing diagrams"
    - "Used /creative-mode for visual exploration and layout optimization"
