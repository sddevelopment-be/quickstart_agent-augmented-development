result:
  summary: "Comprehensive aggregate assessment of 7 completed orchestration tasks reveals 100% success rate, excellent efficiency (avg 17.8 min), and strong directive compliance. Framework is production-ready for simple/sequential workflows; POC3 validation recommended before complex convergent workflow deployment."

  key_findings:
    - "100% task success rate (7/7 tasks completed without errors)"
    - "100% work log compliance (all tasks followed Directive 014)"
    - "Average completion time: 17.8 minutes (automation: 3.0 min, documentation: 20-60 min)"
    - "1 critical bug discovered and fixed proactively during E2E testing"
    - "Token usage ranges 15k-33k tokens depending on task complexity"
    - "All 10 core capabilities (F1-F10) validated and operational"
  recommendations:
    - "Standardize timestamp metadata (backfill missing started_at/completed_at)"
    - "Adopt token usage tracking standard across all agents"
    - "Execute POC3 multi-agent chain validation (task 1738)"
    - "Formalize subtask relationships in task schema"
    - "Implement automated orchestrator polling to reduce assignment latency"
