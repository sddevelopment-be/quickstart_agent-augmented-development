title: Create ADR for Agent-Specific Iteration Templates
description: 'Assess feasibility and design patterns for agent-specific iteration
  templates

  (e.g., documentation sprint, test automation cycle). Document decision on

  whether to create specialized templates and provide implementation guidance.

    line 243
  notes:
  - Evaluate need for specialized iteration templates per agent type
  - 'Consider: documentation sprint, test automation cycle, refactoring cycle'
  - Assess benefits vs. maintenance overhead
  - Provide design patterns if adopting
  - Create follow-up tasks for implementation if approved
  - Document decisions in ADR-013 and work log per Directive 014

result:
  summary: 'Completed comprehensive ADR-013 rejecting agent-specific iteration templates.
    Decision based on evidence (100% success rate with generic templates), architectural
    alignment (preserves simplicity/autonomy/emergence), and cost-benefit analysis
    (5 vs 40+ templates). Recommended lightweight alternatives: agent profile enhancements,
    expanded task examples, workflow pattern documentation. Clear data-driven revisit
    conditions established.'

  - work/logs/architect/2025-11-24T1813-architect-agent-specific-iteration-templates-adr.md
  decision: rejected
  rationale:
  - Generic templates working exceptionally well (100% completion rate, zero failures)
  - High maintenance cost (40+ specialized templates vs 5 generic)
  - Architectural misalignment (violates simplicity, autonomy, emergence principles)
  - Premature optimization (framework only 1 week old)
  - Template selection complexity (multi-level decision tree)
  - Simpler alternatives exist (profile guidance, expanded examples)
  alternatives_provided:
  - Enhanced agent profile guidance (immediate action)
  - Expanded task examples in task-examples.yaml (immediate action)
  - Workflow pattern documentation (supplementary)
  - Task context enrichment (future consideration)
  - Do nothing (viable baseline)
  revisit_conditions:
  - Template-related failure rate exceeds 5%
  - Agent feedback indicates template inadequacy
  - Framework scales to 25+ agents
  - 100+ tasks per agent type completed (pattern maturity)
  - Compliance requirements mandate standardization
