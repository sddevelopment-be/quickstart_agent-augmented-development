title: "Assess Agentic Framework Efficiency Trends (Quality-to-Cost Ratio)"

description: |
  Review aggregated token metrics and assess whether the agentic framework
  is improving over time in terms of quality-to-cost ratio. Analyze trends
  in token usage, context size, and task completion efficiency since tracking
  began. Provide recommendations for framework optimization if needed.
