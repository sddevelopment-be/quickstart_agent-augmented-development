title: "Aggregate Token Count and Context Metrics into Timestamped JSON Report"

description: |
  Collect all token count and context metrics from completed work logs and
  synthesize them into a single timestamped JSON report. This enables
  trend analysis of framework efficiency and quality-to-cost ratio over time.
