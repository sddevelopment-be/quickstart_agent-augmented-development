title: "Streamline canonical changelog"

description: |
  docs/CHANGELOG.md now includes both the historical entries and the new GitHub
  automation notes that were previously living in the root changelog. It is
  thorough but overly verbose and difficult to skim. Tighten the structure so
  release highlights remain readable without losing key metrics.

artefacts:
  - docs/CHANGELOG.md
  - work/logs/curator/

context:
  repo: "sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development"
  branch: "copilot/review-issue-8-final-iteration"
  notes:
    - "Focus on clarity and brevity; keep Keep-a-Changelog headings but favor bullets over prose."
    - "Retain critical metrics (scores, counts) but collapse redundant sentences."
    - "Ensure stylistic alignment with AGENTS.md tone guidance."
    - "Document decisions in a work log per Directive 014."
    - "Capture prompt lessons per Directive 015 if material."
    - "Coordinate with architect only if structural changes are needed."
