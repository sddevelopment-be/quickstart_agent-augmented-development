title: 'POC3: Update orchestration diagrams with metrics visualization'
artefacts:
  - docs/architecture/diagrams/workflow-sequential-flow.puml
  - docs/architecture/diagrams/metrics-dashboard-concept.puml
  - docs/architecture/diagrams/DESCRIPTIONS.md
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  notes:
    - 'Chain position: 2/5 (Architect → **Diagrammer** → Synthesizer → Writer-Editor → Curator)'
    - 'Primary goal: Visualize orchestration metrics standard from ADR-009'
    - Update existing workflow-sequential-flow.puml to include timing annotations
    - Create new metrics-dashboard-concept.puml showing metrics capture points
    - Add accessibility descriptions to DESCRIPTIONS.md for both diagrams
    - 'Reference: docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-009-orchestration-metrics-standard.md'
    - 'Validation: Render diagrams locally or mark with ⚠️ if unverified'
    - 'Success criteria: Both diagrams validated with ✅, alt-text added'
    - 'Mode: Use /creative-mode for visual exploration, /analysis-mode for validation'
  dependencies:
    - 2025-11-23T1738-architect-poc3-multi-agent-chain
success_criteria:
  - workflow-sequential-flow.puml updated with timing/metrics annotations
  - metrics-dashboard-concept.puml created showing ADR-009 metrics capture points
  - DESCRIPTIONS.md updated with alt-text for both diagrams
  - Both diagrams marked with ✅ validation in work log
  - Metrics block included in task result (per ADR-009)
  - Per-artifact integrity markers in work log
  - Work log follows tiered structure (Core tier minimum)
deliverables:
  - Updated workflow diagram with metrics overlay
  - New metrics dashboard concept diagram
  - Accessibility descriptions for both diagrams
  - Work log with structured metrics and per-artifact validation
