context:
  repo: "sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development"
  branch: "copilot/continue-orchestration-framework-implementation"
  notes:
    - "Meta-task: Review all completed work in work/done/ and corresponding work/logs/"
    - "Goal: Create aggregate report on efficiency, quality, and lessons learned"
    - "Focus on orchestration framework implementation quality"
    - "Identify patterns in agent collaboration effectiveness"
    - "Surface insights for continuous improvement"
    - "Adhere to Directive 014 for metrics regarding token usage and context size"

      - "work/done/*.yaml (all completed tasks)"
    work_logs:
      - "work/logs/**/*.md (all agent work logs)"
    focus_areas:
      - "Task completion efficiency (time from assigned to done)"
      - "Quality of deliverables (artifact completeness, adherence to standards)"
      - "Handoff effectiveness (clean transitions between agents)"
      - "Directive compliance (especially Directive 014 metrics)"
      - "Lessons learned patterns across agents"
      - "Token usage and context size metrics per task"
      - "Agent collaboration quality"

  analysis_methodology:
    - "Parse all done task YAML files for timestamps and metadata"
    - "Extract efficiency metrics from work logs"
    - "Identify successful patterns and anti-patterns"
    - "Cross-reference task results with work log lessons learned"
    - "Synthesize findings into coherent narrative"
    - "Provide evidence-based recommendations"

  success_criteria:
    - "All done tasks reviewed (10+ tasks as of 2025-11-23)"
    - "All work logs analyzed for lessons learned"
    - "Aggregate report provides actionable insights"
    - "Efficiency metrics dashboard established"
    - "Token usage and context size data compiled (Directive 014)"
