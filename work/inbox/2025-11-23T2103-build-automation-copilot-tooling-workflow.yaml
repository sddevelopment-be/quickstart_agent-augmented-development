title: "Create GitHub Copilot Tooling Setup Workflow"

artefacts:
  - .github/copilot/setup.sh
  - .github/workflows/copilot-setup.yml
  - docs/HOW_TO_USE/copilot-tooling-setup.md

context:
  repo: "sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development"
  branch: "main"
  notes:
    - "Implement GitHub Copilot custom tooling setup as per GitHub documentation"
    - "Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment#preinstalling-tools-or-dependencies-in-copilots-environment"
    - "Enable preinstallation of tools/dependencies in Copilot's environment"
    - "Optimize agent execution with pre-configured tooling"
    - "Consider repository-specific tools: rg, fd, ast-grep, jq, yq, fzf (per Directive 001)"
    - "Follow-up assessment task will be created for architect to evaluate value"

  requirements:
    workflow_features:
      - "Automated tool installation in Copilot environment"
      - "Pre-cache common dependencies (Python, Node.js packages)"
      - "Setup repository-specific CLI tools (rg, fd, ast-grep, etc.)"
      - "Configure environment variables for agent execution"
      - "Validation step to ensure tools are available"
    
    setup_script_requirements:
      - "Idempotent installation (safe to run multiple times)"
      - "Fast execution (<2 minutes for common tools)"
      - "Error handling with clear diagnostics"
      - "Version pinning for reproducibility"
      - "Support for both Linux and macOS environments"
    
    documentation_requirements:
      - "Explanation of benefits for agent execution"
      - "List of preinstalled tools and their purpose"
      - "How to customize for derivative repositories"
      - "Troubleshooting common setup issues"
      - "Performance impact measurements"

  technical_design:
    - "Create .github/copilot/setup.sh for tool installation"
    - "Implement GitHub Actions workflow for validation"
    - "Use apt/brew for system tools, pip/npm for language packages"
    - "Cache installation artifacts for faster runs"
    - "Follow security best practices (verify checksums, use official sources)"
    - "Integrate with existing CI/CD validation workflows"

  tools_to_preinstall:
    - "ripgrep (rg) - fast code search"
    - "fd - fast file finder"
    - "ast-grep - structural code search"
    - "jq - JSON processor"
    - "yq - YAML processor"
    - "fzf - fuzzy finder"
    - "Python packages from requirements.txt"
    - "Repository-specific validation scripts"

  acceptance_criteria:
    - ".github/copilot/setup.sh script created and tested"
    - "GitHub Actions workflow validates setup process"
    - "All tools from Directive 001 available in Copilot environment"
    - "Setup completes in <2 minutes"
    - "Documentation explains purpose and customization"
    - "Validation passes in CI/CD pipeline"
    - "Follow-up architect assessment task created"

  next_steps:
    - "After completion, create assessment task for architect"
    - "Architect will evaluate added value for this repository"
    - "Architect will project benefits for downstream/derivative repositories"

  dependencies:
    - "Directive 001: CLI & Shell Tooling"
