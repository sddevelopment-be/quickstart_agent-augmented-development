context:
  notes:
    - "Framework currently lacks ability to schedule recurring tasks"
    - "Many tasks need regular execution (audits, documentation updates)"
    - "Design simple scheduling mechanism compatible with file-based orchestration"
    - "Consider cron-like patterns vs relative scheduling"
    - "Integration with existing task workflow"
  
  requirements:
    - "Recurring task specification format"
    - "Scheduling metadata (frequency, next execution)"
    - "Orchestrator integration for scheduled task generation"
    - "Simple interval-based scheduling (daily, weekly, monthly)"
  
  use_cases:
    - "Regular framework audits (monthly)"
    - "Documentation refresh (quarterly)"
    - "Dependency updates (weekly)"
    - "Performance assessments (quarterly)"
