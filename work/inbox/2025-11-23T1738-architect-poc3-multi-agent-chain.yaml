  notes:
    - "Final validation POC before declaring orchestration production-ready"
    - "Tests multi-agent chain: Architect → Diagrammer → Synthesizer → Writer-Editor → Curator"
    - "Primary goal: Validate handoff reliability across >2 agents"
    - "Secondary goals: Measure cumulative overhead, test artifact consistency, validate convergent workflows"
    - "Reference: work/logs/architect/2025-11-23T1730-post-pr-review-orchestration-assessment.md Section 5.3"
    - "Reference: work/logs/architect/2025-11-23T1125-orchestration-poc-dual-assessment.md Section 7"
    - "Create initial task in chain (Architect task) that spawns downstream tasks"
    - "Proposed deliverable: Update ADR-008 with lessons learned from POC1 & POC2, spawn diagram update task"

  success_criteria:
    - "All 5 agents execute successfully with proper state transitions"
    - "Handoffs auto-created without manual intervention"
    - "Artifact consistency maintained across chain"
    - "Metrics captured per-agent (timing, tokens, artifacts)"
    - "No conflicts detected during convergent phase"
    - "Final curator audit reports zero mismatches"

  metrics_to_capture:
    - "Token usage per agent phase"
    - "Time per artifact creation and validation"
    - "Handoff latency (completed_at to next task created_at)"
    - "Log size by tier (Core vs Extended)"
    - "Total chain duration"
