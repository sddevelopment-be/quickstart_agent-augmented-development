artefacts:
  - .github/copilot/setup.sh
  - docs/HOW_TO_USE/copilot-tooling-setup.md

context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  source_assessment: docs/architecture/assessments/copilot-tooling-value-assessment.md
  notes:
    - Security hardening identified as immediate priority in assessment
    - Add SHA256 checksum verification for yq and ast-grep downloads
    - Document checksums in setup script comments
    - Update user documentation with security improvements
    - Timeline: Within 1 week (immediate priority)
    - Effort: 2-3 hours

  security_requirements:
    - Add SHA256 checksums for yq v4.40.5 (Linux AMD64)
    - Add SHA256 checksums for ast-grep v0.15.1 (Linux x86_64)
    - Verify checksums before installation
    - Fail gracefully with clear error messages if verification fails
    - Document checksum update process in comments

  implementation_notes:
    - Use sha256sum command for verification
    - Store checksums as constants at top of script
    - Add verification function that's reusable
    - Update docs to mention security verification
