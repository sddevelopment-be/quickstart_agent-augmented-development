title: 'POC3: Synthesize ADR-009 metrics and diagram updates'
artefacts:
  - docs/architecture/synthesis/poc3-orchestration-metrics-synthesis.md
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  notes:
    - "Chain position: 3/5 (Architect → Diagrammer → **Synthesizer** → Writer-Editor → Curator)"
    - 'Primary goal: Aggregate ADR-009 standard with diagram visualizations'
    - Create synthesis document linking ADR-009 concepts to diagram implementations
    - Verify cross-artifact consistency between ADR-009 and updated diagrams
    - Validate metrics capture points shown in metrics-dashboard-concept.puml match ADR-009 spec
    - 'Reference: docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-009-orchestration-metrics-standard.md'
    - 'Reference: docs/architecture/diagrams/workflow-sequential-flow.puml (updated with metrics)'
    - 'Reference: docs/architecture/diagrams/metrics-dashboard-concept.puml (new)'
    - 'Reference: docs/architecture/diagrams/DESCRIPTIONS.md (updated accessibility)'
    - Follow ADR-009 standards (metrics block, per-artifact validation, tiered logging)
dependencies:
  - 2025-11-23T1738-architect-poc3-multi-agent-chain
  - 2025-11-23T2100-diagrammer-poc3-diagram-updates
success_criteria:
  - Synthesis document created showing ADR-009 → diagram mappings
  - Cross-artifact linkage verified (no inconsistencies detected)
  - Metrics capture points in diagram match ADR-009 specification
  - Accessibility descriptions validated for completeness
  - Metrics block included in task result (per ADR-009)
  - Per-artifact integrity markers in work log
  - Work log follows tiered structure (Core tier minimum)
deliverables:
  - Synthesis document aggregating ADR-009 + diagrams
  - Cross-artifact consistency validation report
  - Handoff notes for writer-editor (clarity improvements)
