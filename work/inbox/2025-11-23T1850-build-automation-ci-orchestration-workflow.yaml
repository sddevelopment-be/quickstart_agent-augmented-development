  workflow_requirements:
    trigger: "Schedule (hourly) + manual dispatch"
    steps:
      - "Checkout repository"
      - "Set up Python 3.10+ environment"
      - "Install dependencies (PyYAML)"
      - "Run work/scripts/agent_orchestrator.py"
      - "Commit and push changes (if any artifacts created)"
      - "Update WORKFLOW_LOG.md with run results"
      - "Notify on failures via GitHub Issues"
    permissions: "Contents: write, Issues: write"
    
  technical_considerations:
    - "Use GitHub Actions cache for Python dependencies"
    - "Implement concurrency controls (cancel-in-progress for same branch)"
    - "Add timeout limit: 5 minutes max"
    - "Configure GITHUB_TOKEN permissions explicitly"
    - "Add dry-run mode via workflow_dispatch input"
