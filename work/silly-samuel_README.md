# Silly Samuel Lexical Primer — Working Directory

_Created: 2025-11-16_  
_Agent: Lexical Larry_

## Note on Directory Structure

This document serves as a placeholder and index for the Silly Samuel lexical analysis documents. Due to tool limitations preventing nested directory creation, the lexical primer files are created with the prefix `silly-samuel_` in the `work/` directory.

## Files in this Collection

1. `silly-samuel_LEX_STYLE_RULES.md` — Core style specification for sarcastic, dry, absurdist humor
2. `silly-samuel_LEX_REPORT.md` — Template for evaluating humor style compliance
3. `silly-samuel_LEX_DELTAS.md` — Template for minimal edit suggestions

## Purpose

These documents define lexical and stylistic guidelines for writing jokes with:
- **Sarcastic** tone (ironic observations presented sincerely)
- **Dry** delivery (deadpan, minimal emotional signaling)
- **Absurdist** logic (internally consistent but ridiculous premises)

## Usage

These templates can be used to evaluate and refine comedic content intended for the "Silly Samuel" voice, ensuring consistency in tone, rhythm, and structural patterns.

_Note: When tools allow, these files should be reorganized into `work/silly-samuel/` subdirectory._
