# Manager Mike Profile Enhancement Log

## Date: 2026-02-11

## Authority
**Decision Maker:** Human In Charge  
**Approval:** "Manager Mike Handles Orchestration? Agreed, approved for immediate execution."  
**Context:** Previous assessment identified Option A (Mike handles spec/review/implementation orchestration) as preferred approach

---

## Enhancement Summary

Manager Mike agent profile enhanced with orchestration capabilities to coordinate multi-phase spec-driven development cycles.

### Phase 1: Profile Enhancement ✅

**Added Section: "Orchestration Scope"** (after Specialization)
- Defines multi-phase cycle coordination responsibilities
- Establishes boundary with Planning Petra (tactical vs strategic)
- Reinforces delegation-only principle (no direct content work)

**Added Section: "Orchestration Patterns"**
- **6-Phase Spec-Driven Cycle:** End-to-end workflow pattern
  - Phase 1: Specification (Analyst Annie)
  - Phase 2: Architecture Review (Architect Alphonso)
  - Phase 3: Implementation Planning (Planning Petra)
  - Phase 4: Implementation (Backend/Frontend specialists)
  - Phase 5: Code Review (Code Reviewer Cindy)
  - Phase 6: Integration (Backend/DevOps)

- **Status Reporting:** YAML format for cycle progress tracking
- **Blocker Handling:** Protocol for surfacing and escalating issues
- **Orchestration Vocabulary:** Standardized terminology (batch, iteration, cycle, hand-off, phase checkpoint, blocker)
- **Common Handoff Patterns:** Detailed orchestration cycle handoffs mapping all phase transitions

### Phase 2: Operating Procedure Updates ✅

**Enhanced Operating Procedure:**
1. Context Assembly
2. **Orchestration Planning** (new: reference 6-phase pattern)
3. Delegation
4. Status Tracking
5. **Blocker Management** (new: escalation protocol)
6. **Phase Transitions** (new: validation gates)
7. Reporting

**Preserved existing procedures:**
- "First Pass (Simple Coordination)" - for non-orchestrated work
- "Ongoing Coordination" - for continuous monitoring

### Phase 3: Handoff Pattern Extensions ✅

**Added Orchestration Cycle Handoffs:**
- Human → Analyst Annie (initiative to specification)
- Analyst Annie → Architect Alphonso (spec to architecture)
- Architect Alphonso → Planning Petra (architecture to planning)
- Planning Petra → Implementation Team (tasks to execution)
- Implementation Team → Code Reviewer Cindy (code to review)
- Code Reviewer Cindy → Integration (approval to deployment)

Each handoff includes:
- Trigger conditions
- Mike's validation criteria
- Expected artifacts
- Next-phase delegation

## Validation Results

### Size Compliance ✅
- **File size:** 11,076 bytes (~10.8 KB)
- **Word count:** 1,285 words
- **Target:** ~8KB (slightly over, but within acceptable range for enhanced capabilities)

### Structure Integrity ✅
```
## 1. Context Sources
## 2. Purpose
## 3. Specialization
   ### Orchestration Scope [NEW]
## 4. Collaboration Contract
   ### Output Artifacts
   ### Operating Procedure [ENHANCED]
   ### Operating Procedure: First Pass (Simple Coordination)
   ### Operating Procedure: Ongoing Coordination
## 5. Orchestration Patterns [NEW]
   ### 6-Phase Spec-Driven Cycle
   ### Status Reporting
   ### Blocker Handling
   ### Orchestration Vocabulary
   ### Common Handoff Patterns
      #### Orchestration Cycle Handoffs [NEW]
## 6. Mode Defaults
## 7. Initialization Declaration
```

### Success Criteria ✅

- ✅ Orchestration scope clearly defined
- ✅ 6-Phase cycle pattern documented
- ✅ Status reporting format specified (YAML example provided)
- ✅ Blocker handling protocol clear (4-step escalation)
- ✅ Boundary with Planning Petra explicit (tactical vs strategic)
- ✅ Handoff patterns cover full cycle (6 transitions mapped)
- ✅ No role bleed (delegation-only principle reinforced in multiple sections)

## Directive Compliance

**Directive 014 (Work Log):** This log captures enhancement rationale, changes, and validation  
**Directive 007 (Agent Declaration):** Manager Mike authority confirmed for orchestration coordination  
**Directive 035 (Specification Frontmatter):** Referenced in handoff validation criteria  
**DDR-001 (Primer Execution):** No primer required for profile enhancement (direct implementation)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Key Principles Maintained
1. **Delegation-Only:** Mike never performs specialist work (analysis, planning, coding, reviewing)
2. **Traceability:** All phase transitions logged in WORKFLOW_LOG
3. **Human Escalation:** Blockers surfaced immediately, not self-resolved
4. **Lightweight Coordination:** Status updates only at phase transitions or blocker events

### Tactical vs Strategic Boundary
- **Manager Mike (Tactical):** Execute THIS cycle, track THIS batch, coordinate THIS handoff
- **Planning Petra (Strategic):** Plan roadmap, prioritize milestones, forecast capacity

### Next Steps (Not in Scope)
- Implementing actual orchestration workflow (future task)
- Creating AGENT_STATUS.md templates (future task)
- Testing orchestration with real cycle (future task)

## Artifact Location

**Enhanced Profile:** `doctrine/agents/manager.agent.md`  
**Change Type:** Additive (no breaking changes)  
**Backward Compatible:** Yes (existing coordination workflows unaffected)

---

## Sign-Off

**Enhanced by:** Manager Mike (self-enhancement per human approval)  
**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Human Review Required:** No (approved for immediate execution)
