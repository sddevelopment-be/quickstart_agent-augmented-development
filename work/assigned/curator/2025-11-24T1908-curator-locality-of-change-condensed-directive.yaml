title: Create Condensed Directive from Locality of Change Approach
description: 'Create a concise directive version of the Locality of Change approach
  document.

  The full approach has been moved to .github/agents/approaches/locality-of-change.md.


  Create a condensed directive (016_locality_of_change.md) that captures the core

  principles and decision framework in a shorter, more actionable format suitable

  for the directives section.


  Focus on:

  - Essential principles (2-3 core ideas)

  - Quick decision checklist (5-7 points)

  - When to apply this directive

  - Clear do''s and don''ts


  Target length: 1-2 pages vs the current 7KB approach document.
