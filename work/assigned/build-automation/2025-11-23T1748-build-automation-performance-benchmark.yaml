title: Orchestrator Performance Benchmarking
artefacts:

- work/benchmarks/results/baseline-metrics.json
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  notes:
  - Critical validation gap from post-PR-review assessment
  - 'Reference: work/logs/architect/2025-11-23T1730-post-pr-review-orchestration-assessment.md
    Section 7.1'
  - 'NFR4-6 require empirical validation: cycle time, validation speed, scalability'
  - Need baseline metrics before declaring production-ready
  - Benchmark should inform scaling decisions
  non_functional_requirements_to_validate:
    nfr4:
      claim: Coordinator completes cycle in <30 seconds
      test: Measure cycle time with 10, 50, 100 tasks in various states
    nfr5:
      claim: Task schema validation completes in <1 second per task
      test: Measure validation time per task, aggregated over 100+ tasks
    nfr6:
      claim: Directory structure supports 1000+ tasks without performance degradation
      test: Create 1000 tasks, measure orchestrator operations
  benchmark_scenarios:
    baseline:
      description: Empty work directories
      measure: Orchestrator cycle time with no tasks
    light_load:
      description: 10 tasks (2 inbox, 3 assigned, 5 done)
      measure: Cycle time, assignment time, status update time
    moderate_load:
      description: 50 tasks (10 inbox, 15 assigned, 25 done)
      measure: Cycle time, conflict detection time, all operations
    heavy_load:
      description: 100 tasks (20 inbox, 30 assigned, 50 done)
      measure: Cycle time, validation time, scalability indicators
    stress_test:
      description: 1000 tasks (various states)
      measure: Performance degradation, bottlenecks, limits
  metrics_to_capture:
    per_scenario:
    - Total cycle time (seconds)
    - assign_tasks() duration
    - process_completed_tasks() duration
    - check_timeouts() duration
    - detect_conflicts() duration
    - update_agent_status() duration
    - archive_old_tasks() duration
    - Memory usage (peak)
    - Disk I/O operations
    validation_specific:
    - Schema validation time per task
    - Structure validation time
    - Naming validation time
  technical_implementation:
  - Use Python's time.perf_counter() for high-precision timing
  - Use memory_profiler for memory usage tracking
  - Create synthetic test tasks (valid YAML)
  - Run each scenario 5 times, report mean + stddev
  - Generate JSON results for machine processing
  - Generate markdown report for human reading
  - Include system specs (CPU, RAM, disk type)
  acceptance_criteria:
  - All 5 scenarios benchmarked
  - 'NFR4: Cycle time <30 seconds validated (or exceptions noted)'
  - 'NFR5: Validation time <1 second/task validated'
  - 'NFR6: 1000-task test completes without degradation (or limits identified)'
  - Bottlenecks identified and documented
  - Recommendations for optimization (if needed)
  - Baseline metrics captured for future comparison
  deliverables:
  - Reusable benchmark script
  - Performance report with graphs/tables
  - JSON results for trending over time
  - Recommendations section
  - Comparison to NFR claims (pass/fail)
  dependencies:
  - 'Orchestrator: work/scripts/agent_orchestrator.py'
  - 'Validation scripts: work/scripts/validate-*.py'
  - Task template for generating synthetic tasks
