context:
  notes:
  - Implements ADR-013 zip-based distribution
  - Create CI/CD pipeline to package framework releases as zip artifacts
  - Generate META/MANIFEST.yml with file checksums (sha256)
  - 'Package structure: framework_core/, scripts/, META/'
  - 'Curate core directories: .github/agents/, docs/directives/, docs/guidelines/,
    docs/templates/, validation/, work/ scaffolds'
  - Ensure POSIX-compliant shell scripts for portability
  - 'Output: quickstart-framework-<version>.zip'
