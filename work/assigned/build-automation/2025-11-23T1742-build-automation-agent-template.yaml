  notes:
  - High-priority gap from post-PR-review assessment
  - 'Reference: work/logs/architect/2025-11-23T1730-post-pr-review-orchestration-assessment.md
    Section 7.2'
  - Need standardized agent implementation pattern to ensure consistency
  - Template should enforce proper lifecycle hooks and error handling
  - Reduce cognitive load for new agent development
  template_requirements:
    base_class_features:
    - 'Standard lifecycle hooks: init, validate, execute, finalize'
    - Automatic task loading from assigned/<agent>/ directory
    - "Status transition enforcement (assigned \u2192 in_progress \u2192 done/error)"
    - Result block generation with timing metrics
    - Work log creation with standard sections
    - Error handling with proper error status and messages
    - next_agent handoff creation helper
    - Artifact validation (files exist after execution)
    configuration:
    - Agent name from environment or config
    - Work directory path configuration
    - Mode support (/analysis-mode, /creative-mode, /meta-mode)
    - Logging level control
    example_implementation:
    - Concrete agent demonstrating template usage
    - 'Simple task: create markdown report from YAML data'
    - Shows proper lifecycle hook implementation
    - Demonstrates error handling
  technical_design:
  - Python 3.10+ with type hints
  - Use Path objects for file operations
  - Leverage existing YAML utilities from agent_orchestrator.py
  - Include timing decorators for metrics capture
  - Provide abstract methods for agent-specific logic
  - Support both synchronous and async execution patterns
  documentation_requirements:
  - 'Step-by-step guide: Creating a new agent'
  - Lifecycle hook documentation with examples
  - Best practices for task processing
  - Error handling patterns
  - Testing your agent locally
  - Integration with orchestrator
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Base class with all lifecycle hooks defined
  - Example agent that runs successfully
  - Documentation complete and clear
  - Template reduces agent creation effort by >50%
  - Enforces consistent status transitions
  - Includes comprehensive error handling
  dependencies:
  - 'Orchestrator: work/scripts/agent_orchestrator.py'
  - 'Task schema: docs/templates/agent-tasks/task-descriptor.yaml'
  - 'Architecture: docs/architecture/design/async_multiagent_orchestration.md'
