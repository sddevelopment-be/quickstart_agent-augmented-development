title: Review Implementation Progress and Adherence to Architecture Vision
artefacts:
- docs/architecture/assessments/implementation-progress-review.md
- docs/architecture/recommendations/architecture-alignment-report.md
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: copilot/execute-file-based-orchestration
  notes:
  - 'Requested by @stijn-dejongh in PR #24 comments'
  - Review implementation of file-based orchestration framework
  - Assess adherence to architectural vision and technical design
  - 'PR #24 includes 2 complete iterations with 5 tasks completed'
  - POC3 multi-agent chain 60% complete (3/5 phases)
  - 'Significant infrastructure delivered: agent templates, Copilot tooling'
  implementation_scope_to_review:
    orchestration_core:
    - work/scripts/agent_orchestrator.py - Task routing and lifecycle management
    - File-based orchestration approach implementation
    - "Task lifecycle: inbox \u2192 assigned \u2192 done"
    - Handoff mechanism and follow-up task creation
    - Status dashboard updates (AGENT_STATUS.md, WORKFLOW_LOG.md)
    agent_standardization:
    - work/scripts/agent_base.py - Agent template base class
    - work/scripts/example_agent.py - Concrete implementation example
    - 'Lifecycle hooks: init, validate, execute, finalize'
    - Status transition enforcement
    - Work log generation helpers
    infrastructure:
    - .github/copilot/setup.sh - Environment tooling setup
    - .github/workflows/copilot-setup.yml - Validation workflow
    - 'Validation scripts: validate-task-schema.py, validate-work-structure.sh'
    poc3_deliverables:
    - 'ADR-009: Orchestration Metrics Standard'
    - Metrics dashboard concept diagram
    - POC3 synthesis document (cross-artifact validation)
    documentation:
    - docs/HOW_TO_USE/multi-agent-orchestration.md
    - docs/HOW_TO_USE/creating-agents.md
    - docs/HOW_TO_USE/copilot-tooling-setup.md
  review_dimensions:
    architectural_vision:
    - Alignment with file-based orchestration ADRs (ADR-002, ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005)
    - Adherence to simplicity and transparency principles
    - Git-native coordination maintained
    - No hidden state or complex orchestration frameworks introduced
    - Composability of agent specializations
    technical_design:
    - Implementation matches technical design specifications
    - Python code quality (type hints, Path objects, error handling)
    - YAML schema compliance for tasks
    - Idempotency of operations
    - Platform compatibility (Linux/macOS)
    - Performance targets met (<30s orchestrator cycle, <2min setup)
    code_quality:
    - Comprehensive error handling
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Testability (example agent demonstrates patterns)
    - Documentation completeness
    - Maintainability considerations
    framework_consistency:
    - Directive 014 compliance (all work logs)
    - ADR-009 metrics capture
    - Agent profile alignment
    - File naming conventions
    - Task schema adherence
    poc3_validation:
    - Multi-agent chain reliability (3/5 phases complete)
    - Handoff mechanism effectiveness
    - Cross-artifact consistency (synthesizer validation)
    - Metrics capture quality
    - Zero inconsistencies found by synthesizer
  assessment_approach:
  - Review completed task YAMLs in work/done/
  - Analyze work logs in work/logs/
  - Examine implementation code in work/scripts/
  - Cross-reference with ADRs and technical designs
  - Evaluate POC3 chain artifacts for consistency
  - Review iteration summaries for framework health metrics
  - Compare acceptance criteria vs actual deliverables
  deliverables:
    implementation_progress_review:
    - Executive summary of implementation status
    - Adherence assessment by architectural dimension
    - Technical design compliance analysis
    - Code quality evaluation
    - POC3 chain validation results
    - Gaps identified (if any)
    - Strengths and exemplary implementations
    architecture_alignment_report:
    - Alignment score by ADR
    - Recommendations for improvements
    - Risk assessment (technical debt, maintainability)
    - Evolution path suggestions
    - Prioritized action items (if needed)
    - Production readiness assessment
  success_metrics_to_evaluate:
    quantitative:
    - Task completion rate (currently 100%)
    - Orchestrator cycle time (target <30s)
    - Validation success rate (currently 100%)
    - Work log compliance (currently 100%)
    - POC3 chain progress (60% complete)

    - Code clarity and maintainability
    - Documentation comprehensiveness
    - Framework simplicity maintained
    - Agent specialization boundaries respected
    - Multi-agent coordination effectiveness
  acceptance_criteria:
