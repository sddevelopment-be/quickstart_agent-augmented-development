context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: copilot/continue-orchestration-framework-implementation
  notes:
  - Follow-up to synthesizer assessment task 2025-11-23T1843-synthesizer-done-work-assessment
  - Review Sam's aggregate report on completed work efficiency and quality
  - Assess existing ADRs against actual implementation results
  - 'Evaluate solution fitness: Do current architectural decisions serve the actual
    needs?'
  - Deliberate on necessary follow-up actions
  - Create new tasks if architectural gaps or improvements identified
  analysis_objectives:
    synthesizer_review:
    - Evaluate quality and completeness of synthesizer's assessment
    - Validate efficiency metrics against architectural expectations
    - Identify discrepancies between intended and actual outcomes
    - Surface architectural assumptions that need revisiting
    adr_assessment:
      focus_adrs:
      - 'ADR-002: File-Based Asynchronous Agent Coordination'
      - 'ADR-003: Task Lifecycle and State Management'
      - 'ADR-004: Work Directory Structure'
      - 'ADR-005: Coordinator Agent Pattern'
      questions:
      - Are the decisions documented in ADRs proving effective in practice?
      - Do actual efficiency metrics match predicted outcomes?
      - Are there unintended consequences or trade-offs surfacing?
      - What architectural refinements are needed?
    solution_fitness:
      evaluation_criteria:
      - Does the orchestration framework meet its stated goals?
      - Are agents collaborating effectively with current structure?
      - Is the file-based approach scaling as expected?
      - Are handoffs clean and reliable?
      - Is the complexity justified by the benefits?
      - What are the failure modes and how well are they handled?

      required_sections:
      - Synthesizer assessment review and validation
      - ADR effectiveness analysis
      - Solution fitness evaluation
      - Architectural trade-off deliberation
      - Identified gaps and opportunities
      - Decision rationale for each follow-up action
      - 'Metrics: token usage, context size (Directive 014)'
  deliberation_process:
  - Read and validate synthesizer aggregate report
  - Compare reported metrics against ADR predictions
  - Evaluate each existing ADR for fitness
  - Identify architectural gaps or misalignments
  - Deliberate on trade-offs for potential improvements
  - Create specific, actionable follow-up tasks
  - Document decisions in ADR-010
  - Create comprehensive work log per Directive 014
  success_criteria:
  - Synthesizer report thoroughly reviewed and validated
  - All relevant ADRs assessed for effectiveness
  - Solution fitness evaluation completed with clear verdict
  - ADR-010 created if architectural decisions needed
  - Follow-up tasks created for all identified improvements
  - Work log documents complete deliberation process
  - Recommendations are architecturally sound and implementable
  - Token usage and context size metrics captured
