## Detailed Findings

{{List files and specific violations that break core rules}}

Example:

- `bits/routine.md` — Exclamation points for emphasis (lines 2, 5, 9)

### Minor Issues (⚠️)
{{List files with style drift that weakens impact but doesn't violate hard rules}}

Example:
- `stories/anecdote.md` — Paragraph too long (5 sentences), weakens timing
- `tweets/thread.md` — Em-dash overuse (4 instances), dilutes effect
