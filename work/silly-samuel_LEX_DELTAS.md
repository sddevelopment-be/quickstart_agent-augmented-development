## Edit Categories

### High Priority (Critical Rule Violations)

### Medium Priority (Style Drift)

### Low Priority (Optional Enhancements)
Suggestions that could improve but aren't strictly necessary.

## {{path/to/joke.md}}

### Rule Violated: {{No Self-Aware Markers}}
**Priority:** High (❗️)

```diff
- I made a spreadsheet to track my procrastination lol
+ I made a spreadsheet to track my procrastination.
- It was pretty funny honestly
+ The irony was noted.
```

**Rationale:** Remove "lol" and "honestly" — self-aware markers break deadpan tone. Replace with understated observation.

---

### Rule Violated: {{Punctuation Discipline}}
**Priority:** High (❗️)

```diff
- This is SO ridiculous!!!
+ This raises several questions.
- Why would anyone do this?!
+ Why would anyone do this?
```

**Rationale:** Eliminate exclamation points (banned unless ironic quotes). Replace with period or single question mark.

---

### Rule Violated: {{Short Paragraphs for Timing}}
**Priority:** Medium (⚠️)

```diff
- I started a new productivity system and spent three hours setting it up and customizing all the templates and now I use it to track how much time I waste organizing productivity systems which feels very meta and slightly concerning.
+ I started a new productivity system.
+ Spent three hours setting it up.
+ Now I use it to track how much time I waste organizing productivity systems.
+ The meta-nature is concerning.
```

**Rationale:** Break into shorter paragraphs. Creates breathing room for comedic timing. Maintains voice while improving rhythm.

---

### Rule Violated: {{Understatement Principle}}
**Priority:** Medium (⚠️)

```diff
- My entire team quit on the same day. It was absolutely devastating!
+ My entire team quit on the same day.
+ It was mildly inconvenient.
```

**Rationale:** Replace emotional emphasis with deadpan understatement. Contrast between event and reaction creates comedy.

---

### Rule Violated: {{No Joke Explanations}}
**Priority:** High (❗️)

```diff
  My cat joined the Zoom meeting.
  She had opinions about Q3 projections.
- (Which was funny because cats don't understand business!)
```

**Rationale:** Delete explanation entirely. Joke lands better without commentary. Trust audience to get it.

---

### Rule Violated: {{Specific Details Over Generic}}
**Priority:** Low (✓ → ✓✓)

```diff
- I bought a plant to improve my workspace.
+ I bought a succulent to improve my workspace.
  It died within a week.
- Now I have a small monument to my nurturing skills.
+ Now I have a small monument to my botanical incompetence.
```

**Rationale:** "Succulent" more specific than "plant" (harder to kill = more absurd). "Botanical incompetence" adds formal/casual mismatch.

### Rule Violated: {{Formal/Casual Vocabulary Mismatch}}
**Priority:** Medium (⚠️)

```diff
- I messed up the presentation really badly.
+ I exhibited suboptimal presentation performance.
  My boss was not impressed.
+ She initiated a "feedback conversation."
```

**Rationale:** Shift to overly formal language for mundane failure. Adds ironic layer through register mismatch.

---

### Rule Violated: {{Em-dash Overuse}}
**Priority:** Medium (⚠️)

```diff
- I tried meditation — failed at that too — now I feel bad about failing at relaxing — which defeats the purpose — obviously.
+ I tried meditation.
+ Failed at that too.
+ Now I feel bad about failing at relaxing.
+ The irony is noted.
```

**Rationale:** Too many em-dashes (4) breaks rhythm. Convert to short sentences. Maintains deadpan delivery with better pacing.

---

### Rule Violated: {{Setup Language Removal}}
**Priority:** High (❗️)

```diff
- So this funny thing happened at work today...
+ The quarterly review had an unexpected development.
- You won't believe what my coworker said!
+ My coworker made an observation.
```

**Rationale:** Remove sitcom-style setup ("So this funny thing", "You won't believe"). Lead with deadpan statement instead.

## Before/After Example

### Original (Multiple Violations)
```
So I started a meditation app and it's been pretty crazy lol! I'm supposed to relax but I keep getting stressed about whether I'm doing it right!!! The irony is hilarious honestly. Maybe I should just give up on the whole mindfulness thing because I'm clearly terrible at it haha.
```

**Issues:** Setup language, "lol"/"haha", exclamation overload, self-aware markers, over-explanation, no paragraph breaks.

### Revised (Compliant)
```
I downloaded a meditation app.
The instructions say to "let go of judgment."
I spent twenty minutes judging my inability to let go of judgment.
The app sent me a congratulatory badge.
```

**Improvements:** Deadpan delivery, short paragraphs, understatement, absurdist logic, no self-aware markers, clean landing.

---

## Notes

- All edits preserve original authorial voice
- Changes target style compliance, not content transformation
- Reject any edit that flattens unique rhythm or removes personality
- When in doubt, maintain deadpan sincerity over comedic "safety"
