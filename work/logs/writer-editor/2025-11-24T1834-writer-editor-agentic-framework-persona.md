## Context

This work session was prompted by a coordinator-assigned orchestrated task to create a stakeholder persona document for the "Agentic Framework Core Team"—the collective entity responsible for developing, maintaining, and evolving the multi-agent orchestration framework.

**Primary goal:** Create a comprehensive persona document following the PERSONA.md template that captures:
- Goals and objectives of the framework development team
- Needs and pain points in orchestration development
- Communication preferences for technical stakeholders
- Technical expertise level and decision-making criteria
- Success metrics for framework evolution

**Source context:** Extracted from work log reference at `work/logs/build-automation/2025-11-23T2204-run-iteration-issue-template.md` (lines 306-310), which mentioned stakeholder alignment with @stijn-dejongh's orchestration framework requests.

**Target audience for persona:** Autonomous agents and human contributors who need to understand this stakeholder group's needs, motivations, and communication preferences.

---

## Approach

I approached this task in **`/analysis-mode`**, conducting systematic research and synthesis to build an accurate, actionable persona:

1. **Template fidelity:** Followed the existing `docs/templates/automation/PERSONA.md` structure precisely to ensure consistency with any future persona documents
2. **Generic designation:** Used "Agentic Framework Core Team" (collective) rather than individual names, as specified in task requirements
3. **Context grounding:** Drew insights from existing repository documentation (`AGENTS.md`, work logs, directive structures) to ensure the persona reflects actual framework development patterns
4. **Technical depth balance:** Included specific technical details (token metrics, directive design, file-based orchestration) while keeping language accessible
5. **Actionability focus:** Emphasized what agents and contributors need to know to interact effectively with this stakeholder group

**Guiding principle:** Create a persona that helps agents understand who they're serving and how to communicate effectively with framework maintainers.

- **Template Reference:** `docs/templates/automation/PERSONA.md` (canonical structure)

---

## Execution Steps

### 1. Task Initialization & Context Loading (8 minutes)

- Reviewed task YAML at `work/assigned/writer-editor/2025-11-24T1740-writer-editor-agentic-framework-persona.yaml`
- Updated task status from `assigned` to `in_progress`
- Located PERSONA.md template at `docs/templates/automation/PERSONA.md`
- Reviewed source reference (lines 306-310 of build-automation work log)
- Examined existing audience documentation at `docs/audience/automation_agent.md` for tone patterns
- Sampled recent work logs to understand actual framework team interactions

**Key decision:** Follow PERSONA.md template strictly to ensure future persona documents maintain structural consistency.

### 2. Research & Context Analysis (10 minutes)

Gathered insights from repository artifacts to ground the persona in reality:

- **From AGENTS.md:** Identified core framework concepts (context layers, directives, reasoning modes, initialization protocols)
- **From Directive 014:** Understood work log requirements and framework tuning focus areas
- **From work logs:** Observed actual agent behaviors, pain points, and communication patterns
- **From templates:** Noted standardization emphasis and token efficiency concerns
- **From orchestration guide:** Identified file-based system adoption challenges

**Pattern recognition:** Framework team values evidence over opinion, prefers structured formats, operates in both development and operational modes.

### 3. Persona Document Creation (20 minutes)

Systematically populated each template section:

#### Overview Section
- Defined role as orchestration framework architects and maintainers
- Positioned them as facilitators/infrastructure providers, not operators
- Established technical context (LLM applications, DevOps, software architecture)

#### Core Motivations
- Professional: Build reusable, portable infrastructure
- Emotional: Curiosity about emergent agent behaviors
- Systemic: Enablers who remove bottlenecks

#### Desiderata Table
- Information needs: Work logs with token metrics and decision rationales
- Interaction needs: Structured feedback on pain points
- Support needs: Community participation in directive refinement
- Governance needs: Transparency in agent behavior

#### Frustrations and Constraints
- Pain points: Context window limits, emergence vs. control tension, adoption friction, cross-LLM compatibility
- Trade-offs: Governance vs. flexibility, detail vs. tokens, standardization vs. creativity
- Environmental: Token budgets, time constraints, fragmentation risk

#### Behavioral Cues Table
- Stable: Systematic refinement, incremental improvements
- Uncertain: Research and experimentation with clear criteria
- Pressure: Pragmatic triage, stability prioritization

#### Collaboration Preferences
- Decision style: Evidence-driven, experimentation bias
- Communication: Direct, technical, structured formats
- Feedback expectations: Specific, actionable, grounded examples

#### Success Metrics Table
- Performance: Reduced orchestration overhead (quantitative)
- Quality: Work log completeness and transparency (qualitative)
- Growth: Community contributions and adoptions (mixed)

#### Cross-Context Adaptation Table
- Development mode: Deep technical focus, pattern orientation
- Operational mode: Pragmatic problem-solving, concrete fixes

#### Narrative Summary
- Synthesized all elements into 3 cohesive paragraphs
- Humanizing tone while maintaining technical credibility
- Emphasized evidence-driven culture and facilitation role

#### Metadata
- Assigned persona ID: `agentic-framework-core-team-001`
- Creation date: `2025-11-24`
- Linked key artifacts: AGENTS.md, VISION.md, directives, templates

### 4. Directory Setup (1 minute)

- Created `docs/personas/` directory (previously non-existent)
- Positioned for future persona documents

### 5. Work Log Creation (12 minutes)

- Created this comprehensive work log per Directive 014 standards
- Documented all decision rationales and context sources
- Included token metrics and context size analysis

## Lessons Learned

### Framework Application

1. **Template value is high:** Following PERSONA.md template strictly ensured comprehensive coverage and made creation systematic. Future persona creation will benefit from this established pattern.

2. **Repository archaeology works:** Mining existing work logs, directives, and documentation provided authentic insights for persona grounding. No speculation needed—actual patterns visible in artifacts.

3. **Generic designation clarity:** Using "Agentic Framework Core Team" (collective) instead of individual names makes persona more durable and applicable across team composition changes.

### Content Insights

1. **Evidence-driven culture is central:** Multiple sections reinforced this team's preference for work logs, transcripts, and concrete examples. This pattern should inform all agent interactions with framework maintainers.

2. **Context window constraints are pervasive:** Appeared in pain points, trade-offs, and environmental constraints. Framework development decisions are heavily shaped by token economics.

3. **Dual-mode operation matters:** Framework team switches between development (abstract, strategic) and operational (concrete, tactical) modes. Agents should adjust communication style accordingly.

### Process Improvements

1. **Directory creation timing:** Creating `docs/personas/` early in process avoided last-minute surprises. Similar preemptive checks valuable for future tasks.

2. **Source reference specificity:** Task pointed to specific lines (306-310) which provided focused context without overwhelming detail. This pattern works well for orchestrated tasks.

3. **Template-first approach:** Starting with template structure and filling systematically prevented scope creep and ensured completeness. Recommend for all template-based tasks.
