## Context

High-priority orchestration task to analyze all work logs across the repository and synthesize actionable improvement ideas for the agentic framework. Task requested by @stijn-dejongh in PR #24 comments following multiple successful orchestration iterations.

**Scope:**
- Analyze 41 work logs across 10 agent directories (work/logs/)
- Extract improvement ideas from Lessons Learned sections
- Identify patterns across multiple work logs
- Assess directive compliance and effectiveness
- Analyze metrics (duration, tokens, context size)
- Create comprehensive synthesis document
- Generate follow-up tasks for architect and manager

**Initial Conditions:**
- File-based orchestration framework operational
- Multiple iterations completed (POC1, POC2, POC3 phases)
- ADR-009 metrics standard established
- Directive 014 work log structure in use
- Rich corpus of execution data available

## Approach

Applied **systematic multi-source analysis methodology** combining:

1. **Comprehensive Reading:** Analyzed all 41 work logs sequentially
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Identified common behaviors, successful strategies, recurring challenges
3. **Directive Validation:** Assessed compliance rates and effectiveness
4. **Metrics Analysis:** Extracted duration, token, context patterns
5. **Cross-Agent Synthesis:** Compared approaches across agent types
6. **Evidence-Based Recommendations:** Grounded all suggestions in actual work log data
7. **Prioritized Categorization:** Grouped improvements by impact and effort

**Key Decision:** Structured synthesis as comprehensive reference document (~44KB) with:
- Executive summary (top 10 improvements)
- Agent-by-agent analysis (6 agents detailed)
- Directive effectiveness assessment (9 directives evaluated)
- Categorized improvements (16 detailed + 7 additional)
- Recurring themes (5 identified)
- Quick wins vs strategic investments
- Implementation roadmap (4 phases)

**Why This Approach:**
- Comprehensive coverage ensures no insights missed
- Agent-specific patterns reveal specialization effectiveness
- Directive analysis validates governance framework
- Categorization enables efficient prioritization
- Evidence citations support decision-making
