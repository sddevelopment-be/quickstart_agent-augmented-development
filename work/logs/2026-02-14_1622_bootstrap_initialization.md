**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Time:** 16:22 UTC  
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot CLI (General Purpose)  
**Task:** Complete bootstrap initialization per AGENTS.md

## Guidelines Loaded

### Core Doctrine Stack (4 files, 389 lines total)

1. **`doctrine/guidelines/bootstrap.md`** — 71 lines  
   Bootstrap protocol and initialization sequence

2. **`doctrine/guidelines/general_guidelines.md`** — 31 lines  
   Core behavioral principles (clarity, cooperation, small changes)

3. **`doctrine/guidelines/operational_guidelines.md`** — 56 lines

## Context Validation

✅ Bootstrap protocol loaded  
✅ General guidelines loaded (highest precedence)  
✅ Operational guidelines loaded (high precedence)  
✅ Local doctrine overrides loaded (non-conflicting with core)  
✅ Work log created in `work/logs/`

---

## Operating Mode

**Default Mode:** `/analysis-mode` (systemic decomposition & trade-offs)  
**Tone:** Clear, calm, precise, sincere — peer-collaboration stance

---

## Key Constraints Acknowledged

- Prefer small, incremental changes over large rewrites
- Use `work/` for coordination, `output/` for ready artifacts
- Respect `docs/` as source of truth — modify only when instructed
- Follow TDD workflow (Directive 017) — tests before implementation
- Minimum 80% coverage on new code
- Unsigned commits for agent work: `git commit --no-gpg-sign`
- Update `doctrine/GLOSSARY.md` when introducing new terminology

---

## Integrity Symbols

- ❗️ Critical error / misalignment detected
- ⚠️ Low confidence / assumption-based reasoning
- ✅ Alignment confirmed

---

## Available Aliases (Loaded for Reference)

- `/analysis-mode` — Default reasoning mode
- `/creative-mode` — Option generation & pattern shaping
- `/meta-mode` — Rationale reflection & alignment
- `/validate-alignment` — Check operational + strategic constraints
- `/require-directive <code>` — Load specific directive on-demand

---

## Next Steps

Awaiting task assignment. Ready to:
1. Accept task specification
2. Load relevant specialist profile if needed
3. Load additional directives on-demand
4. Execute work with alignment checks

---

**Status:** ✅ Bootstrap complete — All layers synchronized and aligned
