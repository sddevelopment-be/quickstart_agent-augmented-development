DEPENDENCY DIRECTION RULE VIOLATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Correct dependency flow:
  ✅ Local (docs/architecture/adrs/) → Framework (doctrine/)
  ❌ Framework (doctrine/) → Local (docs/architecture/adrs/)

Framework artifacts must remain portable across repositories.
