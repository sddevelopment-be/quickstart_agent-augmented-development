Read:
- docs/VISION.md (pending if exists)

## 2. Task Understanding
Mandate: Maintain structural, tonal, metadata integrity. Prepare for initial audit capability.
Focus: Establish workflow directories (`work/curator/`), confirm alias awareness, set next actionable steps.

## 3. Planned Aliases Usage
- /analysis-mode for initial structural check pass.
- /validate-alignment after first discrepancy sampling.
- /summarize-notes for converting raw audit observations.

## 4. Next 3 Steps
1. Enumerate candidate artifacts for initial mini-audit (README.md, AGENTS.md, any pattern docs). 
2. Draft DISCREPANCY_REPORT.seed.md with sampling method.
3. Run /validate-alignment on sampled files and record flags.

## 5. First Action Executed
Created initialization log file documenting bootstrap procedure and intended alias utilization.

## 6. Recommendations
Proceed with step 1: gather file list and classify by structural + tonal axis before deeper remediation suggestions.

## 7. Alignment & Risk Flags
Current state: ✅ Aligned with specialization.
Risks: None detected at bootstrap stage.
