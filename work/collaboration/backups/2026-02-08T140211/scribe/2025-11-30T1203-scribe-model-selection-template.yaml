description: 'Provide the documentation and directive updates requested in the Platform

  Next Steps assessment so every new task captures preferred models, constraints,

  and privacy/cost considerations.

  '
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  source_assessment: docs/architecture/assessments/platform_next_steps.md
  notes:
  - Create a dedicated template file in docs/templates/agent-tasks/.
  - Update the appropriate directive (likely 004 or 012) with an addendum on model
    selection hints.
  - Include examples referencing router config fields.
requirements:
- Draft docs/templates/agent-tasks/model-selection.yaml with sections for `task_type`,
  `preferred_models`, `hard_constraints` (context window, tool-calls), `cost_ceiling`,
  and `privacy_requirements`.
- Provide narrative guidance plus inline comments for each field.
- Update `.github/agents/directives/004_documentation_context_files.md` (or another
  best-fit directive) to mandate specifying model hints in future tasks and reference
  the new template.
- Add cross-links inside `docs/architecture/assessments/platform_next_steps.md` if
  clarifications are required.
success_criteria:
- Template is merged, linted, and referenced from relevant docs.
- Directive addendum passes any validation (link check) and is logged.
- Work log captures rationale and any follow-up tasks for Implementation agents.
