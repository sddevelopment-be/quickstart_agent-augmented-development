title: Create example workflows for 3 user personas
artefacts:
- docs/examples/ai-power-user-workflow.md
- docs/examples/software-engineer-workflow.md
- docs/examples/process-architect-workflow.md
- docs/examples/troubleshooting-guide.md
context:
  project: LLM Service Layer
  architecture_ref: docs/architecture/design/llm-service-layer-prestudy.md
  milestone: 'Milestone 4: Integration & Distribution'
  batch: 'Batch 4.2: Documentation & Examples'
  personas:
  - AI Power User (Consistency-Seeking) - see docs/audience/ai_power_user.md
  - Software Engineer / Platform Engineer - see docs/audience/software_engineer.md
  - Process Architect - see docs/audience/process_architect.md
  notes:
  - Extract usage scenarios from prestudy (Scenario 1, 2, 3)
  - Provide step-by-step workflows with actual CLI commands
  - Show configuration examples specific to each persona's needs
  - Include before/after comparisons (manual vs. automated workflows)
  - Demonstrate cost tracking and optimization for each persona
  - Troubleshooting guide covers common errors and solutions
acceptance_criteria:
- Each persona workflow is actionable with copy-paste CLI commands
- 'Workflows demonstrate key features: routing, cost optimization, telemetry, budget
  enforcement'
- AI Power User workflow shows single CLI interface and cost tracking
- Software Engineer workflow shows multi-agent orchestration with context chaining
- Process Architect workflow shows team-wide policy enforcement and analytics
- 'Troubleshooting guide covers: tool not found, auth errors, budget exceeded, rate
  limiting'
- Examples tested against actual implementation (or mocks if tools unavailable)
- Documentation follows project style guide and markdown linting rules
dependencies:
- 'Task 12: Acceptance tests complete (validates workflows actually work)'
- 'Task 14: User guide complete (provides context for examples)'
