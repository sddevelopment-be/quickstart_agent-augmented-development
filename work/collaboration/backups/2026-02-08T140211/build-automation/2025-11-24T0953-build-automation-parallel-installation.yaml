title: Optimize setup.sh with parallel tool installation
artefacts:
- .github/copilot/setup.sh
- docs/HOW_TO_USE/copilot-tooling-setup.md
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  source_assessment: docs/architecture/assessments/copilot-tooling-value-assessment.md
  notes:
  - Optimization opportunity from section 5.2 of assessment
  - Refactor to install independent tools concurrently
  - Expected improvement: "120s \u2192 60-80s"
  - Timeline: Q1 2026
  - Effort: 3-4 hours
  implementation_approach:
  - Install rg, fd, jq, yq, fzf, ast-grep in parallel using background jobs
  - Use wait command to synchronize before verification
  - Maintain error handling for individual tool failures
  - Update verification section to work with parallel execution
  - Test on both Linux and macOS platforms
  example_pattern:
  - install_tool 'rg' '...' &
  - install_tool 'fd' '...' &
  - 'wait  # Synchronize before verification'
  task_dependencies:
  - Requires checksum verification task to be completed first
  - Should not proceed until security hardening is in place
