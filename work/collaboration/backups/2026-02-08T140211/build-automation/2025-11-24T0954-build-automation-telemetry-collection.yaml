artefacts:
- .github/copilot/setup.sh
- work/scripts/collect-tool-metrics.sh
- docs/HOW_TO_USE/copilot-tooling-setup.md
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  source_assessment: docs/architecture/assessments/copilot-tooling-value-assessment.md
  notes:
  - Optimization opportunity from section 5.2 of assessment
  - Track which tools are actually used by agents
  - Inform future tool selection decisions
  - Timeline: Q1 2026
  - Effort: 4-6 hours
  telemetry_requirements:
  - Non-invasive collection (no PII, no sensitive data)
  - Track tool invocation counts
  - Measure execution time per tool
  - Record tool version usage
  - Optional/opt-in functionality
  - Privacy-preserving aggregation
  implementation_notes:
  - Add lightweight wrapper functions around tool commands
  - Store metrics in local work/metrics/ directory
  - Provide aggregation script for analysis
  - Document privacy considerations
  - Make telemetry opt-in with environment variable
