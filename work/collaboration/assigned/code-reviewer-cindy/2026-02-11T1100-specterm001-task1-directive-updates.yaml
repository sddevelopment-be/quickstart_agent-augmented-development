# Task: Update Directives for Naming Enforcement

## Context

**Initiative:** SPEC-TERM-001 - Terminology Alignment Refactoring  
**Batch:** Phase 1 - Directive Updates  
**Strategic Goal:** Establish code review guidelines to enforce domain-driven naming conventions

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents future naming anti-patterns from entering codebase
- Provides clear guidance for code reviewers
- Enforces glossary alignment during PR reviews
- Reduces conceptual drift over time
- Foundation for subsequent refactoring tasks

## Objective

Update code review directives to enforce domain-driven naming conventions. Add naming anti-patterns, glossary reference requirements, and PR comment templates. Document medium leniency rule (don't block for style, do require alignment for new code).

## Acceptance Criteria

**MUST:**
- [ ] Add naming anti-patterns to review guidelines
- [ ] Add glossary reference requirements
- [ ] Create PR comment templates for naming issues
- [ ] Document medium leniency rule (guideline, not blocker)
- [ ] Provide examples for each pattern
- [ ] Send team communication about updated guidelines

**SHOULD:**
- [ ] Create quick reference guide for reviewers
- [ ] Add automated checks (if feasible)
- [ ] Link to domain glossary
- [ ] Provide refactoring migration path

**MUST NOT:**
- [ ] Make guidelines overly strict (avoid blocking valid PRs)
- [ ] Require refactoring of existing code (new code only)
- [ ] Add guidelines without examples

## Deliverables

1. **Updated Directives:**
   - Update code review directive (identify which directive applies)
   - Add naming anti-patterns section
   - Add glossary reference requirements

2. **PR Comment Templates:**
   - `docs/code-review/naming-pr-comments.md`
   - Templates for common naming issues
   - Suggested fixes with rationale

3. **Quick Reference Guide:**
   - `docs/code-review/naming-quick-reference.md`
   - One-page cheat sheet for reviewers

4. **Team Communication:**
   - Draft announcement for team
   - Link to updated guidelines
   - Migration timeline (Phase 1 only)

## Test Plan

**Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Review guidelines with sample PRs
- [ ] Verify templates are clear and actionable
- [ ] Confirm examples cover common cases
- [ ] Team feedback gathered (informal review)

**Validation:**
- Use templates on 2-3 recent PRs (retrospective)
- Verify comments are helpful, not blocking
- Adjust based on feedback

## Implementation Notes

### Naming Anti-Patterns to Document

**Pattern 1: Generic "Manager" Suffix**
- ❌ Anti-pattern: `ModelConfigurationManager`
- ✅ Preferred: `ModelRouter` (reflects routing responsibility)
- Rationale: "Manager" is too generic, lacks domain meaning

**Pattern 2: Handler Without Context**
- ❌ Anti-pattern: `TaskAssignmentHandler`
- ✅ Preferred: `TaskAssigner` (simpler, domain-driven)
- Rationale: "Handler" suffix adds no value

**Pattern 3: Load vs Read Confusion**
- ❌ Anti-pattern: `load_config_file()` (for simple file read)
- ✅ Preferred: `read_config_file()` or `load_framework()` (with deps)
- Rationale: load = initialize with dependencies, read = retrieve data

**Pattern 4: State vs Status Confusion**
- ❌ Anti-pattern: Using "state" for operational health
- ✅ Preferred: State = logical condition, Status = operational health
- Rationale: Glossary defines distinct meanings

### PR Comment Templates

Create `docs/code-review/naming-pr-comments.md`:

```markdown
# Code Review: Naming Convention Templates

## Template: Generic Manager Suffix

**Comment:**
> The class name `{ClassName}Manager` uses a generic "Manager" suffix. Consider using a domain-specific term that reflects the actual responsibility.
>
> **Suggestion:** Rename to `{ClassName}Router` (if routing) or `{ClassName}Coordinator` (if orchestrating).
>
> **Rationale:** Per [Domain Glossary](link), we prefer domain-driven naming over generic suffixes.
>
> **Leniency:** This is a guideline for new code. No need to refactor existing code, but let's align new additions with the glossary.

## Template: Load vs Read Confusion

**Comment:**
> The method `load_{resource}()` seems to only read data without initializing dependencies. Consider using `read_{resource}()` instead.
>
> **Distinction:**
> - `load_*()` → Initialize with dependencies (e.g., `load_framework()`)
> - `read_*()` → Retrieve data only (e.g., `read_config_file()`)
>
> **Suggestion:** Rename to `read_{resource}()` if no dependency initialization occurs.
>
> **Leniency:** This is a guideline for clarity. If you prefer to keep "load", please add a comment explaining what's being initialized.

## Template: State vs Status Confusion

**Comment:**
> The variable `{var}_state` appears to track operational health, which is "status" in our glossary.
>
> **Distinction:**
> - `State` → Logical condition (e.g., TaskState: pending/active/done)
> - `Status` → Operational health (e.g., TaskStatus: healthy/degraded/failed)
>
> **Suggestion:** Rename to `{var}_status` for consistency with domain glossary.

## Leniency Rule

**Medium Leniency (Guideline, Not Blocker):**
- ✅ Suggest improvements in PR comments
- ✅ Provide rationale and glossary links
- ❌ Don't block PRs for naming alone
- ❌ Don't require refactoring existing code

**When to Block:**
- New code introduces naming that conflicts with core domain concepts
- Naming causes ambiguity or confusion
- Naming is factually incorrect (not just stylistic)
```

### Quick Reference Guide

Create `docs/code-review/naming-quick-reference.md`:

```markdown
# Naming Conventions: Quick Reference for Code Reviewers

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                 | Preferred Alternative      | Why                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| `*Manager` (generic)         | `*Router`, `*Coordinator`  | Domain-specific term         |
| `*Handler` (adds no value)   | Remove suffix              | Simpler, cleaner             |
| `load_*()` (for simple read) | `read_*()` or `load_*()`   | load = init deps, read = get |
| `state` (for health)         | `status`                   | Glossary distinction         |

## When to Comment

- ✅ New code uses generic suffixes without domain meaning
- ✅ Load/read distinction unclear
- ✅ State/status used inconsistently
- ❌ Existing code (unless refactoring anyway)

## Leniency

**Guideline, not blocker:** Suggest improvements, don't require changes unless causing confusion.

### Team Communication Draft

```markdown
# 📢 Updated Code Review Guidelines: Naming Conventions

Hi team,

We've updated our code review guidelines to include naming convention enforcement per SPEC-TERM-001.

## What's Changed

- Added naming anti-patterns (generic "Manager", "Handler" suffixes)
- Clarified load vs read distinction
- Clarified state vs status distinction
- Created PR comment templates for reviewers

## Leniency Rule

**Medium leniency (guideline, not blocker):**
- We'll suggest improvements in PR comments
- No need to refactor existing code
- Focus on new code alignment with domain glossary

## Resources

- [Naming Quick Reference](link)
- [PR Comment Templates](link)
- [Domain Glossary](link)

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Now):** Directive updates, team communication
- **Phase 2 (2026-02-18+):** Gradual refactoring of core components

Questions? Ask Code Reviewer Cindy or Manager Mike.

## Risk Assessment

**RISK:** Low (directive updates only, no code changes)

**Mitigation:**
- Medium leniency (guideline, not blocker)
- Examples provided for clarity
- Team communication before enforcement
- Feedback loop (adjust based on team response)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Directives updated with naming anti-patterns
- [ ] Glossary reference requirements documented
- [ ] PR comment templates created
- [ ] Medium leniency rule documented
- [ ] Quick reference guide created
- [ ] Team communication drafted and sent
- [ ] Informal team feedback gathered
- [ ] Task 2a unblocked (refactoring can proceed)

## References

- **Specification:** `specifications/initiatives/terminology-alignment-refactoring.md` (SPEC-TERM-001)
- **Glossary:** `docs/glossary.md` (or equivalent)
