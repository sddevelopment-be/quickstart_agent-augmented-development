```markdown
## Specification Completeness Checklist

### Required Sections
- [ ] Executive Summary (present? clear?)
- [ ] Problem Statement (well-defined?)
- [ ] Objectives (specific? measurable?)
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria (testable?)
- [ ] Dependencies (complete list?)
- [ ] Risk Assessment (comprehensive?)

- Risk Assessment: ✅ Comprehensive | ⚠️ Incomplete | ❌ Missing
```

**Acceptance Criteria Evaluation:**
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria Quality Review

### Criteria Evaluation Framework

**Good Criteria (Testable, Measurable):**
- ✅ "All tests pass (100% pass rate)" - Clear, binary
- ✅ "Test coverage ≥90%" - Measurable, specific threshold
- ✅ "Glossary entry added for X" - Binary, verifiable

**Weak Criteria (Ambiguous):**
- ⚠️ "Code quality improved" - Subjective, not measurable
- ⚠️ "Documentation updated" - Vague, incomplete
- ⚠️ "Team notified" - Lacks specificity (when? how?)

**Missing Criteria (Gaps):**
- ❌ No performance criteria (when needed)
- ❌ No rollback criteria (when risky)
- ❌ No integration criteria (when affecting multiple systems)

### SPEC-TERM-001 Evaluation

**Phase 1 (Directive Updates):**
- Criterion: "Add naming anti-patterns to review guidelines"
  - Assessment: ✅ Clear, verifiable
- Criterion: "Document medium leniency rule"
  - Assessment: ✅ Testable (present in docs?)
- Criterion: "Team communication sent"
  - Assessment: ⚠️ Could specify when/how

**Phase 2 (Refactoring):**
- Criterion: "Class renamed ModelRouter"
  - Assessment: ✅ Binary, clear
- Criterion: "All tests pass"
  - Assessment: ✅ Measurable, specific
- Criterion: "Documentation updated"
  - Assessment: ⚠️ Specify which docs

**Overall Phase 2 Quality:** 85% (mostly clear, some minor ambiguity)
```

**Risk Assessment Review:**
```markdown
## Risk Assessment Quality Review

### Risk Identification
- [ ] Technical risks identified (breaking changes, integration issues)
- [ ] Timeline risks identified (dependencies, resource constraints)
- [ ] Team risks identified (communication, coordination)
- [ ] Quality risks identified (test coverage, validation)

### Mitigation Strategies
- [ ] Each risk has mitigation strategy
- [ ] Mitigations are actionable
- [ ] Mitigations are realistic (resource-wise)

### SPEC-TERM-001 Assessment

**Risks Identified:**
1. Breaking changes across ~50 files (HIGH)
   - Mitigation: Incremental updates, tests after each batch ✅
2. Team coordination during refactoring (MEDIUM)
   - Mitigation: Low-activity window, communication plan ✅
3. State/Status conflation in existing code (MEDIUM)
   - Mitigation: Clear migration guide, type checking ✅

**Overall Risk Assessment Quality:** ✅ Comprehensive, well-mitigated
```

### Review Report Template

```markdown
# SPEC-TERM-001 Specification Review Report

**Reviewer:** Analyst Annie  
**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Specification:** SPEC-TERM-001 - Terminology Alignment Refactoring

## Executive Summary

Overall Quality: **B+ (87%)** - Strong specification with minor improvements recommended.

**Strengths:**
- Clear problem statement (terminology drift)
- Testable acceptance criteria (mostly)
- Comprehensive risk assessment
- Phased approach reduces risk

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some acceptance criteria could be more specific
- Success metrics could include quantitative targets
- Rollback plan could be more detailed

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Completeness (90%)
- ✅ All required sections present
- ✅ Problem statement well-defined
- ⚠️ Success metrics could be more quantitative

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Clarity (85%)
- ✅ Most criteria testable and measurable
- ⚠️ "Documentation updated" needs specificity
- ✅ Phase structure clear

### 3. Risk Assessment (95%)
- ✅ Comprehensive risk identification
- ✅ Mitigation strategies actionable
- ✅ Phased approach reduces risk

### 4. Timeline Feasibility (80%)
- ✅ Effort estimates reasonable
- ⚠️ Team coordination window may be tight
- ✅ Dependencies clearly identified

## Recommendations

### For SPEC-TERM-001 Execution
1. **Clarify Documentation Criteria:**
   - Specify which docs: "Update README.md, docs/architecture/*, docstrings"
2. **Add Performance Criteria:**
   - "No performance regression >5% after refactoring"
3. **Enhance Rollback Plan:**
   - Document specific rollback commands for each phase

### For Future Specifications (Planning Petra)
1. **Template Improvement:**
   - Add "Success Metrics" section (quantitative)
   - Add "Rollback Plan" section (detailed)
2. **Acceptance Criteria Guide:**
   - Provide examples of good vs weak criteria
   - Encourage measurability and specificity

## Conclusion

SPEC-TERM-001 is a strong specification suitable for execution. Minor improvements recommended but non-blocking.

**Approval:** ✅ PROCEED with execution (recommendations advisory)
```

### Feedback for Planning Petra Template

```markdown
# Feedback for Planning Petra: SPEC-TERM-001 Review

**From:** Analyst Annie  
**To:** Planning Petra  
**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Subject:** Lessons Learned from SPEC-TERM-001 Review

## Overall Assessment

SPEC-TERM-001 is a high-quality specification. The following feedback is for continuous improvement of future specs.

## Strengths to Maintain

1. **Phased Approach:** Breaking into Phase 1 (directives) and Phase 2 (refactoring) reduces risk.
2. **Clear Problem Statement:** Terminology drift is well-explained with examples.
3. **Comprehensive Risk Assessment:** Risks identified with actionable mitigations.

## Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Acceptance Criteria Specificity
**Current:** "Documentation updated"  
**Recommended:** "Update README.md, docs/architecture/naming-conventions.md, and all docstrings for renamed classes"

**Action:** Add specificity checklist to specification template.

### 2. Success Metrics Section
**Current:** Success metrics embedded in acceptance criteria  
**Recommended:** Dedicated "Success Metrics" section with quantitative targets

**Example:**
```markdown
## Success Metrics

- Code quality: No performance regression >5%
- Team adoption: 100% of new PRs follow naming conventions within 2 weeks
- Maintainability: 20% reduction in naming-related PR comments
```

**Action:** Add "Success Metrics" section to specification template.

### 3. Rollback Plan Detail
**Current:** "Rollback plan documented"  
**Recommended:** Step-by-step rollback procedure per phase

**Action:** Add "Rollback Plan" section to specification template with phase-specific procedures.

## Template Enhancements Recommended

```markdown
# Specification Template Updates

## New Sections to Add

### Success Metrics (Quantitative)
- Performance metrics (if applicable)
- Adoption metrics (for process changes)
- Quality metrics (test coverage, error rates)

### Rollback Plan (Detailed)
- Phase 1 rollback: [specific steps]
- Phase 2 rollback: [specific steps]
- Data recovery: [if applicable]

### Acceptance Criteria Guide
- ✅ Good: "All tests pass (100% pass rate)"
- ⚠️ Weak: "Code quality improved"
- ❌ Poor: "Everything works"
```

## Conclusion

Continue current specification quality. Incremental template improvements recommended for future batches.
```
