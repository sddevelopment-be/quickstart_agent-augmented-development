# Task: Create Planning Refinement Specification

## Context

**Initiative:** Analyst Annie - Process Improvement  
**Batch:** Analyst Tasks  
**Strategic Goal:** Specification for improving planning workflow based on M5.1 and SPEC-TERM-001 execution insights

**Why This Matters:**
- Captures lessons learned from recent batch planning
- Identifies pain points in current planning process
- Provides actionable recommendations for Planning Petra
- Improves future batch planning efficiency
- Establishes continuous improvement cycle

## Objective

Create a specification for planning workflow refinement based on insights from SPEC-TERM-001 review and M5.1 execution patterns. Document current process, identify improvements, and define success metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

**MUST:**
- [ ] Current planning process documented (as-is)
- [ ] Pain points identified (from M5.1, SPEC-TERM-001 observations)
- [ ] Improvement recommendations (actionable)
- [ ] Success metrics defined (measurable)
- [ ] Specification follows template (if exists)

**SHOULD:**
- [ ] Prioritization framework proposed
- [ ] Template enhancements recommended
- [ ] Automation opportunities identified
- [ ] Team feedback mechanisms suggested

**MUST NOT:**
- [ ] Propose changes without evidence/rationale
- [ ] Create overly complex processes (keep pragmatic)
- [ ] Conflict with existing strategic principles

## Deliverables

1. **Planning Refinement Specification:**
   - `specifications/process-improvements/planning-refinement.md`
   - Problem statement
   - Current state assessment
   - Proposed improvements
   - Success metrics

2. **Process Improvement Recommendations:**
   - `work/analysis/planning-process-recommendations.md`
   - Quick wins (implement immediately)
   - Medium-term improvements (next 1-2 batches)
   - Long-term vision (strategic)

3. **Template Updates (if needed):**
   - Proposed changes to specification template
   - Proposed changes to task file template
   - Examples for clarity

## Test Plan

**Validation Approach:**
- Review with Planning Petra (feedback loop)
- Validate recommendations against actual pain points
- Ensure measurability of success metrics
- Check feasibility of proposed changes

## Implementation Notes

### Current Planning Process (As-Is)

Document observed workflow from M5.1 and SPEC-TERM-001:

```markdown
# Current Planning Process Assessment

## M5.1 Execution Observations

### Strengths
- Phased execution (ADR-046 → ADR-045) reduced risk
- Clear dependencies prevented blocking
- Checkpoint reviews caught issues early
- Task file structure enabled traceability

### Pain Points
- Task file creation manual and time-consuming (17 files for M5.1)
- Acceptance criteria sometimes ambiguous (discovered during execution)
- Effort estimates variable accuracy (some tasks exceeded estimates)
- Checkpoint timing not always optimal (delayed validation)

### Metrics
- Planning Time: ~X hours for 17 task files
- Specification Quality Score: B+ (87% from Task 1 review)
- Task File Completeness: 95% (minor fields occasionally missing)
```

### Pain Points Analysis

```markdown
# Pain Points Identified

## 1. Task File Creation Overhead
**Problem:** Creating 17 task files manually took significant time.
**Impact:** Delays batch kickoff, reduces planning efficiency.
**Evidence:** M5.1 task file creation estimated 1-2h in plan.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Template automation (script to generate task files from batch definition)
- Partial generation (generate boilerplate, human fills details)

**Success Metric:** Reduce task file creation time by 50%.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria Ambiguity
**Problem:** Some criteria discovered to be vague during execution.
**Impact:** Task completion uncertainty, rework.
**Evidence:** SPEC-TERM-001 Task 2a had "Documentation updated" (too vague).

**Proposed Solution:**
- Acceptance criteria checklist (must be testable, measurable, specific)
- Examples library (good vs weak criteria)
- Review step (analyst validates criteria before execution)

**Success Metric:** 90% of acceptance criteria rated "clear" in post-execution reviews.

## 3. Effort Estimate Variability
**Problem:** Some tasks exceeded estimates (underestimation).
**Impact:** Timeline slippage, resource overcommitment.
**Evidence:** [Cite specific tasks if available]

**Proposed Solution:**
- Historical data tracking (actual vs estimated for calibration)
- Estimation guidelines (factors to consider)
- Buffer allocation (10-20% contingency for unknowns)

**Success Metric:** Effort estimates within 20% of actuals for 80% of tasks.

## 4. Checkpoint Timing
**Problem:** Checkpoints sometimes delayed validation feedback.
**Impact:** Wasted effort if changes needed.
**Evidence:** ADR-046 Task 4 checkpoint at end (could be earlier).

**Proposed Solution:**
- Earlier checkpoints (after structure creation, before full implementation)
- Lightweight checkpoints (async review, not blocking)
- Risk-based checkpoint placement (high-risk tasks get earlier validation)

**Success Metric:** Checkpoint feedback provided within 24h of request.
```

### Proposed Improvements

```markdown
# Planning Refinement Recommendations

## Quick Wins (Implement Immediately)

### 1. Acceptance Criteria Checklist
**What:** Add checklist to task file template.
**Why:** Prevents ambiguous criteria.
**How:** Update template with validation questions:
- [ ] Is this criterion testable? (yes/no check)
- [ ] Is this criterion measurable? (numeric or binary)
- [ ] Is this criterion specific? (clear what "done" means)

**Effort:** 30min (template update)
**Impact:** High (improves clarity for all future tasks)

### 2. Task File Generation Script (Partial)
**What:** Script to generate task file boilerplate from batch definition.
**Why:** Reduces manual effort by 50%.
**How:** 
```bash
# Usage: generate-task-files.py --batch M5.2 --tasks tasks.yaml
# Generates skeleton task files with metadata, agent assignment
# Human fills: description, acceptance criteria, implementation notes
```

**Effort:** 2-3h (script development)
**Impact:** Medium (saves 30-60min per batch)

## Medium-Term Improvements (Next 1-2 Batches)

### 3. Historical Effort Tracking
**What:** Database/spreadsheet of task estimates vs actuals.
**Why:** Calibrates future estimates.
**How:**
- Track: task_id, estimated_hours, actual_hours, variance
- Review quarterly: identify patterns (which task types underestimated?)
- Adjust estimation guidelines based on data

**Effort:** 4-5h (setup + initial data entry)
**Impact:** Medium-High (improves estimation accuracy over time)

### 4. Risk-Based Checkpoint Framework
**What:** Guidelines for when/where to place checkpoints.
**Why:** Balances validation benefits with execution speed.
**How:**
- High-risk tasks (breaking changes): Early checkpoint (after design)
- Medium-risk tasks (refactoring): Mid-point checkpoint (after partial impl)
- Low-risk tasks (documentation): End checkpoint (after completion)

**Effort:** 2h (document framework)
**Impact:** Medium (optimizes validation timing)

## Long-Term Vision (Strategic)

### 5. Automated Acceptance Criteria Validation
**What:** Tool to validate criteria against quality checklist.
**Why:** Ensures consistency and quality.
**How:** NLP-based analysis (is criterion specific? measurable?).

**Effort:** 20-30h (significant development)
**Impact:** High (long-term quality improvement)

### 6. Planning Dashboard
**What:** Visual dashboard for batch planning and execution.
**Why:** At-a-glance status, dependency visualization.
**How:** Integrate with existing dashboard, add planning view.

**Effort:** 40-50h (significant development)
**Impact:** High (improves visibility and coordination)
```
