# Task: Build Refactoring Techniques Evidence Matrix

## Context

Create an evidence-backed matrix of preferred refactoring techniques and pattern transitions using the curated source list in `work/tasks/learning_refactoring_plan.md`.

## Objective

Produce a structured matrix in `work/research/` that helps Curator Claire select first-wave doctrine tactics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create matrix artifact in `work/research/` with one row per candidate technique.
- [ ] Include problem solved, applicability, risks/failure modes, and prerequisite signals.
- [ ] Mark first-wave recommendations (high confidence and high impact).
- [ ] Include source citations from provided source list.

## Deliverables

- `work/research/2026-02-12-refactoring-techniques-matrix.md`
- Optional supporting notes under `work/research/`
