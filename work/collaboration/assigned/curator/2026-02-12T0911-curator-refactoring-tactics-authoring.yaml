# Task: Author Initial Refactoring Tactics

## Context

Use the researcher matrix to select first-wave techniques and encode them as doctrine tactics.

## Objective

Create deterministic, policy-aligned tactic files in `doctrine/tactics/` using `doctrine/templates/tactic.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 3 new or updated refactoring tactic files created.
- [ ] Each tactic includes intent, preconditions, execution steps, exit criteria, and failure modes.
- [ ] References remain localized and doctrine-stack compliant.
- [ ] Existing related tactic (`refactoring-strangler-fig`) stays coherent with additions.

## Deliverables

- `doctrine/tactics/*refactoring*.md` (new/updated)
