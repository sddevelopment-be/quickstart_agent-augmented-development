# Task: Add Refactoring-to-Pattern Reference Files

## Context

The initiative includes pattern-level context to support tactic selection and escalation from low-level refactors to architectural motifs.

## Objective

Create concise doctrine references under `doctrine/docs/references/` that map selected patterns to refactoring triggers and constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add at least one new reference file under `doctrine/docs/references/`.
- [ ] Include mapping from candidate refactorings to pattern-level target states.
- [ ] Keep content localized to doctrine standards and style.

## Deliverables

- `doctrine/docs/references/*refactoring*`
