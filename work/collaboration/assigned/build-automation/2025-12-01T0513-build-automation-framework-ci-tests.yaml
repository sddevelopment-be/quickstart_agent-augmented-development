title: Run framework test suites plus router/task schema validators in CI

description: 'Extend CI so the framework test suites (interface/core/execution) and
  new

  router/task-schema validators run automatically, satisfying Step 8 of the

  Platform Next Steps assessment.

  '
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  source_assessment: docs/architecture/assessments/platform_next_steps.md
  notes:
  - Reuse the setup-python composite action to avoid redundant installs.
  - Share caching strategy with validation.yml + orchestration.yml.
  - Emit clear failure logs pointing to the exact validator/test that failed.
requirements:
- Update validation.yml to run `pytest tools/validators/test_framework_*.py`.
- Ensure router validator + task schema validator run in the same job or a dedicated
  job with explicit dependency ordering.
- Update orchestration.yml if additional smoke checks are justified, or record rationale
  in the work log if not needed.
- Adjust workflow docs (README or inline comments) to mention the new steps.
success_criteria:
- CI fails when framework tests, router validation, or task schema validation fail
  locally.
- Work log includes before/after workflow logs and runtime impact.
- Validation scripts referenced from docs so future agents can reproduce locally.
