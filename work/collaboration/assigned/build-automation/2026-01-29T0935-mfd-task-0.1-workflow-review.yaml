# Task 0.1: Review and Fix GitHub Workflows

## Context

**Project:** Multi-Format Agent Framework Distribution  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks Batch 3 CI/CD integration  
**Dependencies:** None (pre-requisite task)

Before proceeding with Batch 3 (Automation & Validation), we need to ensure existing GitHub workflows are functional and follow best practices. The current workflow may have outdated actions, missing npm scripts, or configuration issues.

**Why This Matters:**
- Batch 3 will add CI/CD integration for export pipeline
- Need working foundation to build upon
- Avoid discovering issues late in implementation
- Ensure team can validate changes via CI

## Objective

Review existing GitHub workflows and composite actions, identify issues, and implement fixes to ensure they work correctly.

## Detailed Requirements

### Review Scope

1. **Workflow File: `.github/workflows/validate-manuscript.yml`**
   - Check for outdated action versions
   - Verify npm scripts referenced exist in `package.json`
   - Review error handling and failure conditions
   - Check if composite actions are correctly referenced
   - Validate syntax and structure

2. **Composite Actions:**
   - `.github/actions/setup-validation-env/action.yml`
   - `.github/actions/setup-python-env/action.yml`
   - Verify action versions are current
   - Check for deprecated features
   - Validate input/output specifications

3. **Package.json Scripts:**
   - Verify all referenced npm scripts exist:
     - `test:validator`
     - `validate:cross-references`
     - `validate:definitions`
     - `lint:markua`
     - `spell:manuscript`
   - Check if scripts are functional
   - Document missing scripts

### Common Issues to Check

**Action Versions:**
- `actions/checkout@v4` - Current?
- `actions/setup-node@v4` - Current?
- `actions/cache@v3` - Should be v4?
- `actions/github-script@v7` - Current?
- `tj-actions/changed-files@v41` - Current?

**Workflow Issues:**
- `continue-on-error: true` usage - Is this intentional?
- Error aggregation in `validation-errors.log`
- Job dependencies and `needs` clauses
- Conditional execution logic

**Performance:**
- Cache efficiency
- Parallel job execution
- Unnecessary steps

## Expected Outputs

1. **Review Report** (`work/workflows/workflow-review-report.md`)
   - List of issues found
   - Severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Recommended fixes
   - Action items with priorities

2. **Fixed Workflows**
   - Updated `.github/workflows/validate-manuscript.yml` (if needed)
   - Updated composite actions (if needed)
   - Migration notes if breaking changes

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - `.github/workflows/README.md` - Workflow documentation
   - `.github/actions/README.md` - Update if changes made

4. **Testing Evidence**
   - Manual workflow trigger (if possible)
   - OR validation that syntax is correct
   - OR PR with workflow changes to test in CI

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All action versions reviewed and updated to latest stable
- ✅ All referenced npm scripts exist or are documented as missing
- ✅ No syntax errors in workflow files
- ✅ Composite actions properly referenced
- ✅ Review report documents all findings
- ✅ Critical/high issues fixed
- ✅ Medium/low issues documented for future work

## Directives to Follow

**MUST adhere to:**
- **Directive 014:** Create work log documenting review process
- **Directive 018:** Traceable Decisions - Document why changes were made
- **Directive 021:** Locality of Change - Only fix what's broken

## Review Methodology

### Phase 1: Discovery (30 min)

1. **List all workflows and actions:**
   ```bash
   find .github/workflows -name "*.yml"
   find .github/actions -name "action.yml"
   ```

2. **Check action versions against latest:**
   - Visit GitHub Marketplace for each action
   - Compare current version to latest stable
   - Note if major version upgrades available

3. **Verify npm scripts:**
   ```bash
   # Check if scripts exist in package.json
   npm run test:validator --dry-run
   npm run validate:cross-references --dry-run
   npm run validate:definitions --dry-run
   npm run lint:markua --dry-run
   npm run spell:manuscript --dry-run
   ```

### Phase 2: Analysis (45 min)

1. **Review workflow structure:**
   - Job dependencies (needs)
   - Error handling (continue-on-error, failure conditions)
   - Conditional execution (if clauses)
   - Output handling

2. **Identify issues:**
   - Critical: Workflow won't run
   - High: Workflow runs but doesn't catch errors
   - Medium: Suboptimal performance or UX
   - Low: Minor improvements

3. **Check composite actions:**
   - Input/output specifications
   - Shell script correctness
   - Caching strategy
   - Error handling

### Phase 3: Fixes (45-60 min)

1. **Apply fixes for critical/high issues:**
   - Update action versions
   - Fix syntax errors
   - Add missing error handling
   - Update composite actions

2. **Document all changes:**
   - What was changed
   - Why it was changed
   - Testing performed
   - Potential impacts

3. **Create migration notes if needed:**
   - Breaking changes
   - Required updates to other workflows
   - Team communication needed

### Phase 4: Documentation (15 min)

1. **Create review report:**
   - Executive summary
   - Issues found (categorized by severity)
   - Fixes applied
   - Remaining work
   - Recommendations

2. **Update workflow documentation:**
   - README.md in .github/workflows/
   - README.md in .github/actions/
   - Add inline comments if helpful

## Testing Approach

### Local Validation

1. **Syntax validation:**
   ```bash
   # Use actionlint to validate syntax
   docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/repo" rhysd/actionlint:latest -color
   ```

2. **Script verification:**
   ```bash
   # Verify each npm script exists and runs
   npm run test:validator
   npm run validate:cross-references
   # etc.
   ```

### GitHub Testing (if possible)

1. **Trigger workflow manually:**
   - Use `workflow_dispatch` if available
   - Create test PR to trigger on pull_request
   - Push to main to trigger on push

2. **Review workflow run:**
   - Check job execution
   - Verify error handling
   - Validate outputs

## Common Fixes

### Update Action Versions

```yaml
# Before
- uses: actions/cache@v3

# After
- uses: actions/cache@v4
```

### Fix Missing Scripts

```json
// Add to package.json if missing
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:validator": "jest tests/unit/validator.test.js",
    "validate:cross-references": "node ops/scripts/validate-cross-references.js",
    "validate:definitions": "node ops/scripts/validate-definitions.js",
    "lint:markua": "node ops/scripts/remark-lint-markua.mjs",
    "spell:manuscript": "cspell 'manuscript/**/*.md'"
  }
}
```

### Improve Error Handling

```yaml
# Ensure failures are caught
- name: Run validation
  run: npm run validate
  # Remove continue-on-error if errors should fail the build
```

## Timeline

**Start:** Immediately (no dependencies)  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Deadline:** Before starting Batch 2 (to avoid issues in Batch 3)

---

**Task Status:** TODO - Ready to Start  
**Blocking Tasks:** Batch 3 CI/CD integration  
**Critical Path:** Yes (pre-requisite for Batch 3)

---

## Additional Context

**Current Workflow Analysis:**

The `validate-manuscript.yml` workflow has:
- 3 jobs: manuscript-validation, spell-check, validation-summary
- Uses composite action `setup-validation-env`
- References several npm scripts
- Has `continue-on-error: true` on some steps
- Aggregates errors in `validation-errors.log`

**Potential Issues:**
1. Action versions may be outdated (cache@v3 vs v4)
2. npm scripts may not exist (this is a new project phase)
3. Error handling might mask failures
4. Composite action might have issues

**References:**
- GitHub Actions documentation
- Action marketplace for latest versions
- package.json for existing scripts
