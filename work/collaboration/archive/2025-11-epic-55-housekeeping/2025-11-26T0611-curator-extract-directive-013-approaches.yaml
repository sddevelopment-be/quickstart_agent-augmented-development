  notes:
    - "Directive 013 is highly verbose with detailed approach descriptions"
    - "Extract detailed approach descriptions into .github/agents/approaches/tooling_setup/"
    - "Keep directive minimal - just references to approaches"
    - "Make explicit that agents only pull in referenced information when needed"
    - "Structure allows agents to load only task-relevant information"
