  previous_task: 2025-11-23T1738-architect-poc3-multi-agent-chain
  previous_agent: architect
  notes:
  - Update workflow-sequential-flow.puml with timing/metrics annotations
  - Create metrics-dashboard-concept.puml visualizing ADR-009 capture points
  - Add accessibility descriptions for both diagrams to DESCRIPTIONS.md
  - Follow ADR-009 standards (metrics block, per-artifact validation, tiered logging)
  - "Validate rendering or mark with \u26A0\uFE0F if unverified"

result:
  summary: "Validated that workflow diagrams and metrics dashboard meet ADR-009 standards. All deliverables were already complete from previous diagrammer work. Added rendering validation markers to DESCRIPTIONS.md per ADR-009 requirements."

  validation_status:
    - "✅ workflow-sequential-flow.puml: Comprehensive metrics annotations present (15min/8min durations, 12K/5K and 8K/3K tokens, artifact counts, 2min handoff latency)"
    - "✅ metrics-dashboard-concept.puml: Complete ADR-009 visualization with all required/optional metrics, quality standards, and compliance legend"
    - "✅ DESCRIPTIONS.md: Detailed accessibility entries for both diagrams with alt-text, long descriptions, key elements, and cross-references"
    - "✅ ADR-009 compliance: Structured metrics blocks, validation markers, tiered logging standards, accessibility requirements all met"
    - "✅ Rendering validation: workflow-sequential-flow fully rendered, metrics-dashboard-concept syntax validated with CI rendering documented"
