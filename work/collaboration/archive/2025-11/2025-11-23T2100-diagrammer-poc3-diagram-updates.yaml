  notes:
  - "Chain position: 2/5 (Architect \u2192 **Diagrammer** \u2192 Synthesizer \u2192\
    \ Writer-Editor \u2192 Curator)"
  - 'Primary goal: Visualize orchestration metrics standard from ADR-009'
  - Update existing workflow-sequential-flow.puml to include timing annotations
  - Create new metrics-dashboard-concept.puml showing metrics capture points
  - Add accessibility descriptions to DESCRIPTIONS.md for both diagrams
  - 'Reference: docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-009-orchestration-metrics-standard.md'
  - "Validation: Render diagrams locally or mark with \u26A0\uFE0F if unverified"
  - "Success criteria: Both diagrams validated with \u2705, alt-text added"
  - 'Mode: Use /creative-mode for visual exploration, /analysis-mode for validation'
  dependencies:
  - 2025-11-23T1738-architect-poc3-multi-agent-chain
success_criteria:
- workflow-sequential-flow.puml updated with timing/metrics annotations
- metrics-dashboard-concept.puml created showing ADR-009 metrics capture points
- DESCRIPTIONS.md updated with alt-text for both diagrams
- "Both diagrams marked with \u2705 validation in work log"
- Metrics block included in task result (per ADR-009)
- Per-artifact integrity markers in work log
- Work log follows tiered structure (Core tier minimum)
deliverables:
- Updated workflow diagram with metrics overlay
- New metrics dashboard concept diagram
- Accessibility descriptions for both diagrams
- Work log with structured metrics and per-artifact validation
