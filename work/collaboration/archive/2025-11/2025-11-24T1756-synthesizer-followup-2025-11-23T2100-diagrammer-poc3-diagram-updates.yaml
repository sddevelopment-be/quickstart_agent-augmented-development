  notes:
  - Aggregate ADR-009 standard with diagram visualizations
  - Create synthesis document linking ADR-009 concepts to diagram implementations
  - Verify cross-artifact consistency between ADR-009 and updated diagrams
  - Validate metrics capture points in metrics-dashboard-concept.puml match ADR-009
    spec
  - Follow ADR-009 standards (metrics block, per-artifact validation, tiered logging)

result:
  summary: "Synthesized findings from original POC3 chain (5 agents, 2025-11-23) and followup validation (2025-11-27). Created comprehensive aggregate metrics report confirming zero inconsistencies across phases, 100% ADR-009 compliance, and production-ready framework for sequential workflows. Key finding: Artifact durability demonstrated - diagrams remained fully compliant over 4-day period."

  key_findings:
    - "✅ Zero inconsistencies across both phases (original 2025-11-23 + followup 2025-11-27)"
    - "✅ Artifact durability: Diagrams remained 100% ADR-009 compliant after 4 days"
    - "✅ Production readiness: 100% handoff success rate (6/6 successful handoffs)"
    - "✅ Accessibility excellence: All visual artifacts exceed ADR-009 minimum standards"
    - "✅ Agent specialization value: 5 different profiles contributed unique expertise"

next_task_notes:
  - Review aggregate metrics presentation (Section 2) for accessibility
  - Validate terminology consistency across synthesis report
  - Assess executive summary adequacy for stakeholder communication
  - Consider recommendations prioritization (Section 5.4: 11 items)
  - Potential condensation: Section 3.1 could reference original doc vs. repeating details
  - Table redundancy check: Section 7 vs. Section 4.2
