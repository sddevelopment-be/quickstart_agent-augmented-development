      ---\n\n## Objective\n\nExecute an orchestration cycle to process pending tasks\
      \ in the work queue following the file-based orchestration approach.\n\n## Context\n\
      \n- **Orchestration Framework**: Implemented and production-ready (PR #16)\n\
      - **Approach**: File-based orchestration (`.github/agents/approaches/file-based-orchestration.md`)\n\
      - **Work Directory**: `work/` (inbox, assigned, done, logs, collaboration)\n\
      - **Agent Profiles**: `.github/agents/*.agent.md`\n- **Directives**: `.github/agents/directives/`\n\
      - **Mode**: `/analysis-mode` for task execution\n\n## Current Status\n\n_To\
      \ be filled by running:_\n```bash\necho \"Inbox: $(ls work/inbox/*.yaml 2>/dev/null\
      \ | wc -l) tasks\"\necho \"Assigned: $(find work/assigned -name '*.yaml' 2>/dev/null\
      \ | wc -l) tasks\"\necho \"Done: $(ls work/done/*.yaml 2>/dev/null | wc -l)\
      \ tasks\"\n```\n\n## Execution Instructions\n\n### 1. Initialize\n- Initialize\
      \ as Manager Mike per `AGENTS.md` guidelines\n- Read `work/collaboration/AGENT_STATUS.md`\
      \ for current context\n- Verify orchestration framework operational status\n\
      \n### 2. Task Selection\n- Check `work/inbox/` for pending tasks\n- Run `python\
      \ work/scripts/agent_orchestrator.py` to assign tasks\n- Identify top 3 priority\
      \ tasks:\n  - Priority order: critical > high > medium > normal\n  - Consider\
      \ dependencies (tasks with satisfied dependencies first)\n  - Check POC/chain\
      \ continuity (advance multi-agent chains)\n\n### 3. Task Execution\n- Delegate\
      \ each task to appropriate custom agent\n- Follow file-based orchestration lifecycle:\n\
      \  1. Update status: assigned \u2192 in_progress\n  2. Execute task per agent\
      \ specialization\n  3. Create artifacts as specified\n  4. Update task YAML\
      \ with result block\n  5. Update status: in_progress \u2192 done\n  6. Move\
      \ task from `work/assigned/<agent>/` to `work/done/`\n  7. Create work log in\
      \ `work/logs/<agent>/` per Directive 014\n\n### 4. Documentation & Reporting\n\
      - Create work log for each completed task (Directive 014)\n- Update `work/collaboration/AGENT_STATUS.md`\n\
      - Create iteration summary (Manager Mike)\n- Capture metrics: duration, tokens,\
      \ artifacts, validation results\n- Commit changes with `report_progress` after\
      \ each task\n- Update PR description with iteration summary\n- Post Manager\
      \ Mike recap comment to PR\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] At least 1 task completed\
      \ (or all remaining if fewer than 3)\n- [ ] All work logs created per Directive\
      \ 014\n- [ ] `AGENT_STATUS.md` updated with current iteration state\n- [ ] Iteration\
      \ summary created by Manager Mike\n- [ ] Metrics captured and reported\n- [\
      \ ] Framework health assessed (completion rate, validation success, etc.)\n\
      - [ ] Zero validation errors or failures\n- [ ] All artifacts committed and\
      \ pushed\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- **Completed Tasks**: Moved to `work/done/`\n\
      - **Work Logs**: Created in `work/logs/<agent>/`\n- **Iteration Summary**: Added\
      \ to `work/collaboration/`\n- **Updated Status**: `AGENT_STATUS.md` reflects\
      \ current state\n- **Manager Recap**: Comment posted to PR\n- **Metrics Report**:\
      \ Duration, tokens, artifacts, success rate\n\n## References\n\n- **File-Based\
      \ Orchestration**: `.github/agents/approaches/file-based-orchestration.md`\n\
      - **AGENTS.md**: Root orchestration protocol\n- **Directive 014**: Work Log\
      \ Creation (`.github/agents/directives/014_worklog_creation.md`)\n- **ADR-009**:\

      \n## Example Prompt\n\n```\nExecute an orchestration cycle following file-based\
      \ orchestration approach:\n\n1. Initialize as Manager Mike per AGENTS.md\n2.\
      \ Read work/collaboration/AGENT_STATUS.md\n3. Run agent_orchestrator.py to assign\
      \ pending tasks\n4. Execute top 3 priority tasks by delegating to custom agents\n\
      5. Create work logs per Directive 014\n6. Update AGENT_STATUS.md and create\
      \ iteration summary\n7. Post Manager Mike recap comment\n\nEnsure:\n- Tasks\
      \ selected by priority (critical > high > medium)\n- All work logs Directive\
      \ 014 compliant\n- Metrics captured per ADR-009\n- Incremental commits with\
