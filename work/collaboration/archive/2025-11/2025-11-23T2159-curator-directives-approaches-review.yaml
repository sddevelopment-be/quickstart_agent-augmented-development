  assessment_methodology:
  - Read all directives and approaches systematically
  - Cross-reference with agent profiles
  - Compare with actual work logs from iterations 1-3
  - Identify patterns in task executions
  - Check consistency with ADRs
  - Review AGENTS.md for alignment
  - Analyze recent task YAMLs for directive usage
  deliverables:

result:
  summary: |
    Completed comprehensive structural review of all 15 directives and file-based-orchestration approach.
    Framework assessed as production-ready with high quality (85-100% across all dimensions).
    Applied 2 high-priority fixes immediately (directive 003 content, directive 007 reference).
    Identified 0 critical issues, 2 high-priority items (both fixed), 7 medium-priority improvements, 5 low-priority suggestions.
    Overall assessment: Excellent framework health with strong implementation alignment validated against work logs.

  assessment: |
    Framework is production-ready with minor polish recommended.
    Strong practical alignment (100% accuracy vs. implementation).
    No critical gaps identified.
    Recent directives (012-015) demonstrate excellent standards.
    Recommended to proceed with high-priority fixes applied and consider medium-priority improvements in next iteration.
  recommendations_summary:
    immediate: All 2 high-priority fixes applied during review
    short_term: Add version metadata (4 items)
    medium_term: Enhance minimal directives, add cross-reference matrix (3 items)
    long_term: Standardize format, add diagrams, create new directives (5 items)
