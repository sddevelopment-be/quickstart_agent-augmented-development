title: 'Task 4: Phase 2 Implementation Preparation'
description: "Prepare for Phase 2 (routing algorithm implementation) to start after\
  \ Dashboard M4 4.3 completion.\n\nActivities:\n1. Create detailed task breakdown\
  \ for Phase 2 implementation (8 tasks):\n   - Implement extract_task_context() function\n\
  \   - Implement calculate_match_score() function\n   - Implement adjust_for_workload()\
  \ function\n   - Implement adjust_for_complexity() function\n   - Implement resolve_ties()\
  \ function\n   - Implement select_appropriate_agent() entry point\n   - Add structured\
  \ logging\n   - Write unit tests\n\n2. Capacity validation for Phase 2 start:\n\
  \   - Confirm Dashboard M4 4.3 completion date\n   - Check Python Pedro availability\
  \ post-dashboard\n   - Confirm Backend Benny availability for parallel work\n\n\
  3. Dependency validation:\n   - Ensure tactic spec (Task 2) complete before implementation\n\
  \   - Ensure GLOSSARY.md updated for implementation reference\n\n4. Create task\
  \ files in work/collaboration/inbox/\n\n5. Create brief Batch 2 planning document\n"

context:
  background: ASH Batch 1 focuses on documentation. Phase 2 (routing algorithm implementation)
    depends on dashboard completion to free Python Pedro capacity. Need preparation
    work now to enable immediate start when Pedro available.
  milestone: ASH Phase 2 - SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT Tactic
  strategic_value: Early preparation eliminates wait time between Dashboard M4 4.3
    completion and Phase 2 start. Ensures smooth transition and maintains momentum.

requirements:
- Create 8 task files for Phase 2 implementation
- Each task follows standard YAML schema
- Tasks include detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
- Agent assignments validated against capacity
- Dependencies documented (tactic spec must be complete)
- Phase 2 start date confirmed (contingent on dashboard completion)
- Create Batch 2 planning document summarizing phase 2 work
acceptance_criteria:
- 8 task files created in work/collaboration/inbox/
- All task files follow standard schema (id, agent, status, priority, title, description,
  artefacts, context, requirements, acceptance_criteria, dependencies, created_at,
  created_by, estimated_hours, batch, initiative, phase)
- Tasks cover all Phase 2 implementation components
- Agent assignments realistic (Python Pedro primary, Backend Benny backup)
- Estimated hours sum to 10-12h total
- Dependencies on ASH-P2-T1-TACTIC-SPEC documented
- Batch 2 planning document created
- Dashboard completion date confirmed or estimated
- Capacity validation documented in work log
dependencies:
- ASH-P2-T1-TACTIC-SPEC

result:
  summary: Phase 2 preparation superseded by design decision. Implementation will
    be tactic-based (Manager Mike reads and applies SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT tactic
    at decision time) rather than pre-coded Python scripts. Domain layer integration
    completed for hierarchy helper scripts.
