title: Create framework_upgrade.sh POSIX shell script

description: |
  Implement the framework_upgrade.sh script as specified in ADR-013 and the
  technical design document. This script manages safe upgrades of framework
  installations in downstream repositories.
  
  The script must:
  - Be POSIX-compliant (no Bash-specific features)
  - Accept PROJECT_ROOT as parameter
  - Support --dry-run mode (report only, no changes)
  - Compare each framework file against local version:
    - Missing → copy (or report in dry-run) and mark NEW
    - Identical (checksum match) → log UNCHANGED
    - Divergent → write .framework-new, backup existing, log CONFLICT
  - Never touch local/ directory or custom project files
  - Generate upgrade-report.txt with status counts
  - Update .framework_meta.yml only when not in dry-run
  - Calculate SHA256 checksums for conflict detection
  
  Success criteria:
  - Script passes shellcheck validation
  - Handles all three file states correctly (NEW/UNCHANGED/CONFLICT)
  - Creates .framework-new files for conflicts
  - Generates parsable upgrade-report.txt
  - Preserves local customizations completely
  - Works on Linux, macOS, and WSL

artefacts:
  - ops/scripts/framework_upgrade.sh
  - ops/scripts/tests/test_framework_upgrade.sh (test suite)
  - docs/HOW_TO_USE/framework-upgrade.md (usage guide)

context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  related_adrs:
    - ADR-013 Zip-Based Framework Distribution
    - ADR-014 Framework Guardian Agent
  related_docs:
    - docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_technical_design.md
    - docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_architecture.md
  notes:
    - Follow ATDD (directive 016) and TDD (directive 017)
    - Script will be packaged in framework distribution zip
    - Output upgrade-report.txt format critical for Guardian consumption
    - Must handle .framework-new files deterministically
    - Never modify local/ directory under any circumstance

requirements:
  - POSIX shell compliance (tested with dash, bash, sh)
  - Accept PROJECT_ROOT and optional --dry-run flag
  - Read .framework_meta.yml to determine current version
  - For each file in framework_core/:
    - Check if exists in PROJECT_ROOT
    - If missing: copy new file (mark NEW)
    - If exists and identical: skip (mark UNCHANGED)
    - If exists and different: write .framework-new, backup original (mark CONFLICT)
  - Calculate SHA256 checksums using sha256sum or shasum
  - Never modify files under local/ directory
  - Generate upgrade-report.txt with structured output:
    - Summary counts (NEW, UNCHANGED, CONFLICT)
    - Per-file status log
  - Update .framework_meta.yml with new version (unless --dry-run)
  - Support optional backup directory for conflict backups
  - Exit 0 on success, non-zero on critical errors

testing_requirements:
  - Write acceptance tests first (directive 016)
  - Test upgrade with no changes (all UNCHANGED)
  - Test upgrade with new files (NEW)
  - Test upgrade with conflicts (CONFLICT + .framework-new)
  - Test dry-run mode (no filesystem changes)
  - Test local/ directory is never touched
  - Test checksum calculation accuracy
  - Test upgrade-report.txt format
  - Test metadata update
  - Follow TDD cycles for implementation (directive 017)

dependencies:
  - 2025-12-21T0720-build-automation-framework-install-script (must complete first)
  - docs/templates/automation/framework-manifest-template.yml (exists)

estimated_complexity: high
estimated_duration: 2-3 days
risk_level: medium-high
risk_notes: |
  - Checksum calculation must be portable across platforms
  - Conflict detection logic is complex and error-prone
  - Must ensure .framework-new files don't accumulate from failed runs
  - Backup mechanism needs careful design to avoid data loss

rationale: |
  CRITICAL PRIORITY: This script enables safe, repeatable upgrades of the framework
  without destroying local customizations. It's the core mechanism that makes the
  distribution model viable for production use.
  
  HIGH URGENCY: Blocks Framework Guardian implementation (which consumes the
  upgrade-report.txt and .framework-new files). Required for complete distribution
  workflow.

    passed: 46
    failed: 0
    coverage:
      - Script validation (exists, executable)
      - Metadata validation (refuses upgrade without installation)
      - File status detection (NEW, UNCHANGED, CONFLICT)
      - Dry-run mode (no modifications)
      - Local directory protection (never touched)
      - Upgrade report generation (structured format)

  implementation_notes:
    - Used TDD approach: wrote 46 tests first, then implemented
    - SHA256 checksums for reliable file comparison (Git-like)
    - Creates .framework-new files for conflicts (never overwrites)
    - Filters local/ directory (protected from upgrades)
    - Generates human-readable upgrade-report.txt
    - Updates .framework_meta.yml with version and counts
    - Supports --dry-run for safe preview
    - POSIX-compliant (works with sh, dash, bash, ash)
    - Handles spaces and special characters in filenames
    - Comprehensive error handling with specific exit codes
  
  shellcheck_status: info-level warnings only (SC2094 false positives)
  
  documentation_includes:
    - Complete usage guide with examples
    - Conflict resolution workflow (3 options)
    - Dry-run preview instructions
    - Troubleshooting section
    - Best practices (DO/DON'T lists)
    - Integration with Framework Guardian
    - Security considerations

  dependencies_satisfied:
    - Built on patterns from framework_install.sh (Task 1)
    - Follows ADR-013 specifications
    - Compatible with technical design document
    - Ready for Framework Guardian consumption
  
  next_steps:
    - Script ready for packaging in framework distribution
    - Can be tested with real framework upgrades
    - Framework Guardian can consume upgrade-report.txt format
    - Documentation ready for end-user distribution
