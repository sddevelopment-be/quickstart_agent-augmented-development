title: "Create Condensed Directive from Locality of Change Approach"

description: |
  Create a concise directive version of the Locality of Change approach document.
  The full approach has been moved to .github/agents/approaches/locality-of-change.md.
  
  Create a condensed directive (016_locality_of_change.md) that captures the core
  principles and decision framework in a shorter, more actionable format suitable
  for the directives section.
  
  Focus on:
  - Essential principles (2-3 core ideas)
  - Quick decision checklist (5-7 points)
  - When to apply this directive
  - Clear do's and don'ts
  
  Target length: 1-2 pages vs the current 7KB approach document.
