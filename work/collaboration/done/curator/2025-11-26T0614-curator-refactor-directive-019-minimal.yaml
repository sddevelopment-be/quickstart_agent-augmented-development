  notes:
    - "HIGHLY verbose directive - will lead to bad token discipline"
    - "Extract step-by-step information to .github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/"
    - "Use headers as natural splits - create one file per step"
    - "Add general overview in README-style page with references to different steps"
    - "Directive should tell agents to adhere to approach and point to automation scripts"
    - "Keep it minimal - explicitly tell agents to load only task-phase relevant information"
    - "Allows agents to keep only currently needed information in memory"
