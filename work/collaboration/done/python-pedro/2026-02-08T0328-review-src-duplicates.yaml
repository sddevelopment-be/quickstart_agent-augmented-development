description: |
  Analyze the src/ directory (llm_service + framework) to identify duplicate or 
  inconsistent representations of the same concepts. Ensure shared abstractions 
  (Task, Agent, TaskStatus, etc.) are used consistently throughout both modules.

result: |
  Completed comprehensive analysis of src/framework and src/llm_service modules 
  to identify concept duplication. Found 3 high-priority duplications (task I/O, 
  status strings, agent identity) and 3 medium-priority issues (config patterns, 
  timestamps, result blocks). No circular dependencies detected. Proposed 4-phase 
  consolidation strategy with 28 hours estimated effort.
