description: "Analyze the src/ directory (llm_service + framework) to identify duplicate\
  \ or \ninconsistent representations of the same concepts. Ensure shared abstractions\
  \ \n(Task, Agent, TaskStatus, etc.) are used consistently throughout both modules.\n"

result:
  summary: Completed comprehensive analysis of src/framework and src/llm_service modules
    to identify concept duplication. Found 3 high-priority duplications (task I/O,
    status strings, agent identity) and 3 medium-priority issues. No circular dependencies
    detected. Proposed 4-phase consolidation strategy with 28 hours estimated effort.
