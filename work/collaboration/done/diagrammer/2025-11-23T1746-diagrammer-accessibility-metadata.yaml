  notes:
    - "High-priority gap from post-PR-review assessment"
    - "Reference: work/logs/architect/2025-11-23T1730-post-pr-review-orchestration-assessment.md Section 7.2"
    - "Diagrams currently lack textual descriptions for accessibility"
    - "Need to provide inclusive documentation for vision-impaired users"
    - "Improve SEO and context understanding for all users"

  scope:
    diagrams_to_document:
      - "docs/architecture/diagrams/task-lifecycle-state-machine.puml"

  deliverable_structure:
    descriptions_file:
      format: "Markdown table mapping diagram files to descriptions"
      columns:
        - "Diagram Filename"
        - "Alt Text (Short, <125 chars)"
        - "Long Description (Detailed, 2-4 paragraphs)"
        - "Key Elements (Bulleted list)"
        - "Related Documentation (Links)"

    accessibility_audit:
      - "Current state assessment"
      - "Gaps identified"
      - "Recommendations for improvement"
      - "Future maintenance process"

  description_guidelines:
    alt_text:
      - "Concise (<125 characters)"
      - "Describes purpose/content at high level"
      - "Example: 'State machine showing task lifecycle from new to done with error paths'"

    long_description:
      - "2-4 paragraphs explaining diagram"
      - "Describe flow/structure/relationships"
      - "Highlight key transitions and decision points"
      - "Explain color coding or symbols used"

    key_elements:
      - "List major components/nodes/states"
      - "Note important transitions/flows"
      - "Identify entry and exit points"

  integration_requirements:
    - "Reference DESCRIPTIONS.md in README or diagram README"
    - "Add alt-text to SVG files (if technically feasible)"
    - "Update architecture documentation to link descriptions"
    - "Provide guidance for future diagram additions"

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "All existing diagrams have alt-text and long descriptions"
    - "Descriptions are clear and comprehensive"
    - "Audit document identifies improvement areas"
    - "Maintenance process documented"
    - "Cross-references added to architecture docs"

  dependencies:
    - "Existing diagrams: docs/architecture/diagrams/*.puml and *.svg"
    - "Architecture docs: docs/architecture/design/*.md"
