title: 'Task 1.1: Implement simplifyAgent() in claude-code-generator.js'
description: "Create tools/exporters/claude-code-generator.js module. Implement simplifyAgent(agentIR)\
  \ function that transforms full doctrine agent profiles (~100 lines with directive\
  \ tables, bootstrap declarations, mode protocols) into lean Claude Code subagent\
  \ definitions (<40 lines with name, description, tools, purpose, specialization).\
  \ Implement tool name mapping (doctrine lowercase \u2192 Claude Code PascalCase)\
  \ and model inference (architect\u2192opus, dev\u2192sonnet). Write unit tests against\
  \ real agent IRs. See technical design: work/reports/architecture/2026-02-10-SPEC-DIST-002-technical-design.md\
  \ section 2.1.\n"

- Output <40 lines per agent
- Strip directive tables, bootstrap declarations, mode protocols
- Map tools to Claude Code PascalCase names
- Infer model hint from agent role
- Unit tests >85% coverage

result:
  summary: simplifyAgent() implemented with full TDD cycle. 28 unit tests pass. Output
    15 lines per agent (vs 40-line limit). Tool mapping, model inference, content
    stripping all verified.
