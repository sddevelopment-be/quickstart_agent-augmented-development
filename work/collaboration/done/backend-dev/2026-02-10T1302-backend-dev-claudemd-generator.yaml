title: 'Task 1.3: Implement generateClaudeMd() in claude-code-generator.js'
description: 'Implement generateClaudeMd(config) function that composes CLAUDE.md
  from multiple doctrine source files. Extract purpose from docs/VISION.md, directory
  structure from directive 003, conventions from python-conventions.md. Add hardcoded
  common commands section. Add pointers to deeper context. Enforce 120-line limit.
  Graceful degradation when source files missing. Include generation header comment.
  See technical design section 2.1 generateClaudeMd.
