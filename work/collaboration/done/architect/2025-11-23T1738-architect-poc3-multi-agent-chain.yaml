  notes:
  - Final validation POC before declaring orchestration production-ready
  - "Tests multi-agent chain: Architect \u2192 Diagrammer \u2192 Synthesizer \u2192\
    \ Writer-Editor \u2192 Curator"
  - 'Primary goal: Validate handoff reliability across >2 agents'
  - 'Secondary goals: Measure cumulative overhead, test artifact consistency, validate
    convergent workflows'

  - Create initial task in chain (Architect task) that spawns downstream tasks
  - 'Proposed deliverable: Update ADR-008 with lessons learned from POC1 & POC2, spawn
    diagram update task'
  success_criteria:
  - All 5 agents execute successfully with proper state transitions
  - Handoffs auto-created without manual intervention
  - Artifact consistency maintained across chain
  - Metrics captured per-agent (timing, tokens, artifacts)
  - No conflicts detected during convergent phase
  - Final curator audit reports zero mismatches
  metrics_to_capture:
  - Token usage per agent phase
  - Time per artifact creation and validation
  - Handoff latency (completed_at to next task created_at)
  - Log size by tier (Core vs Extended)
  - Total chain duration
  deliverables_per_agent:
    architect:
    - 'ADR update: Incorporate POC1/POC2 lessons into ADR-008'
    - Planning list for downstream tasks
    diagrammer:
    - Update 1 existing diagram (workflow-sequential-flow.puml)
    - Create 1 new diagram (metrics-dashboard-concept.puml)
    synthesizer:
    - Synthesis summary aggregating ADR changes + diagrams
    - Cross-artifact linkage verification
    writer-editor:
    - Polish multi-agent orchestration guide with POC learnings
    - Style and clarity pass
    curator:
    - Consistency audit report
    - Cross-file integrity check
    - Alt-text verification for diagrams
  dependencies:
  - 'POC1 (Curator) completed: work/done/2025-11-23T0722-curator-orchestration-guide.yaml'
