  dependency_summary: Ensure curator implementation matches ADR-011 intent.
  notes:
    - Review Curator Claire’s updates once task `2025-11-24T1945-curator-primer-alias-directive-alignment` is completed.
    - Confirm primer → alias mapping is correctly represented in aliases file and directives, including exceptions/heuristics.
    - Verify each specialist profile references the new directive section rather than duplicating content.
    - Update ADR-011 consequences or addenda if reviewer feedback uncovers additional governance needs.
    - Recommend additional tooling/linting requirements if gaps remain after documentation updates.

result:
  status: completed
  summary: |
    Validation completed. Core documentation is excellent with comprehensive Primer Execution Matrix 
    in Directive 010. Critical gap identified: only 3 of 15 agent profiles (20%) include primer 
    requirement. Recommend completing profile rollout to achieve ADR-011 intent. No new ADR required.

    - work/reports/validations/2025-11-28-primer-directive-validation-report.md
  recommendations:
    - Add primer requirement to remaining 12 agent profiles (High Priority)
    - Create systematic profile update task for Curator Claire (High Priority)
    - Validate work log compliance across other agents (Medium Priority)
    - Develop profile validation tooling (Medium Priority)
