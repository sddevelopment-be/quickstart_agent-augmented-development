title: 'ADR-026: Pydantic V2 for Schema Validation'
artefacts:
- docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-026-pydantic-v2-validation.md
context:
  background: 'During Milestone 1 implementation, Pydantic v2 was chosen for configuration
    schema validation.

    This decision needs to be documented per Directive 018 (Traceable Decisions).

    '
  decision_made: Use Pydantic v2 for YAML schema validation in LLM Service Layer
  alternatives_considered:
  - JSON Schema with jsonschema library
  - Marshmallow for validation
  - attrs with validators
  - Raw validation (dict checking)
  rationale: '- Strong Python type integration

    - Field-level validators

    - Excellent developer experience

    - Performance benefits over v1

    - Native validation error messages

  quality_notes: 'ADR provides comprehensive rationale for Pydantic V2 choice, including:

    - Developer experience benefits (IDE support, type hints)

    - Validation framework completeness (field validators, cross-validation)

    - Production track record (FastAPI, LangChain usage)

    - V2-specific improvements (5-10x performance, better errors)

    All acceptance criteria met, ready for review and approval.
