  artefacts.
- Update AGENT_STATUS to include Guardian readiness + contact cadence.
- Describe how Guardian outputs integrate with work logs + iteration summaries.
testing_requirements:
- Peer review via Curator Claire checklist (include as acceptance note).
- Dry-run template fill using sample data from packaging pipeline.

  artifacts_created:
    - .github/agents/framework-guardian.agent.md (agent profile with authorities, constraints, operating procedures)
    - .github/agents/directives/025_framework_guardian.md (audit/upgrade workflow, escalation triggers, integration protocols)
    - docs/templates/GUARDIAN_AUDIT_REPORT.md (comprehensive audit report template with metadata, statistics, recommendations)
    - docs/templates/GUARDIAN_UPGRADE_PLAN.md (detailed upgrade plan template with conflict classification, resolution guidance, checklists)

    - Directive 025 added to manifest with correct dependencies
    - Ready for peer review via Curator Claire
  testing_readiness:
    - Templates include placeholders for dry-run testing
    - Work directory structure created (logs, assigned, done)
