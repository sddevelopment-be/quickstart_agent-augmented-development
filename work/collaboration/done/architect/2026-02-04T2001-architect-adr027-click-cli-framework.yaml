title: 'ADR-027: Click for CLI Framework'
artefacts:
- docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-027-click-cli-framework.md
context:
  background: 'During Milestone 1 implementation, Click was chosen as the CLI framework.

    This decision needs to be documented per Directive 018 (Traceable Decisions).

    '
  decision_made: Use Click for CLI implementation in LLM Service Layer
  alternatives_considered:
  - argparse (Python stdlib)
  - Typer (type-safe CLI)
  - docopt (declarative CLI)
  - Raw sys.argv parsing
  rationale: '- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation

    - Excellent testing support (CliRunner)

    - Composable subcommands

    - Decorators for clean code

    - Good error handling

    '
  trade_offs: '- Not type-safe by default (unlike Typer)

    - Requires explicit parameter type declarations

    - Learning curve for decorators

    '
  implementation_reference: src/llm_service/cli.py
acceptance_criteria:
- ADR documents Click selection rationale
- Trade-off analysis includes Typer comparison
- References cli.py implementation
- Connects to user experience goals
- Follows Directive 018 format

  summary: 'Created ADR-027 documenting Click selection for CLI framework.

    - Followed standard ADR template (Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences,
    Alternatives)

    - Documented 4 alternatives with detailed comparison table

    - Detailed Click vs Typer trade-off analysis (key decision point)

    - Referenced implementation (cli.py, 4 commands, 83% coverage)

    - Connected to user experience goals (help text, error messages, testing)

    - Aligned with Directive 018 (Traceable Decisions)

  quality_notes: 'ADR provides comprehensive rationale for Click over Typer:

    - Maturity and ecosystem size (10+ years vs 4 years)

    - Extensive testing support (CliRunner)

    - Explicit types = clarity (self-documenting CLI options)

    - Type safety less critical at CLI boundary (Pydantic handles config)

    Includes command structure diagram and user experience examples.

    All acceptance criteria met, ready for review.
