description: 'Design the overall architecture and technical foundation for the Quickstart
  Agent-Augmented

  Development Framework documentation website. This task establishes the technical
  foundation

  for a 5-batch implementation roadmap.


  This is Batch 1 of the Documentation Website Implementation Roadmap. Focus on technology

  selection, repository structure design, and initial setup to enable subsequent content

  migration and creation batches.

      in roadmap).

      If different choice, provide detailed rationale.

      '
    evaluation_criteria:
    - Build speed (target: <5s for 200 pages)
    - Dependency management (prefer: zero runtime dependencies)
    - Theme availability and customization
    - GitHub Pages integration

    structure: 'Design the overall information architecture for the documentation
      site.

      Consider multiple audiences: new users, active users, architects, contributors.

      '
    deliverable: docs-site/ARCHITECTURE.md
    sections:
    - Site Structure Overview (diagram of main sections)
    - Audience Mapping (content for each target audience)
    - Navigation Strategy (menus, sidebar, breadcrumbs)
    - Content Organization (how guides, tutorials, reference, ADRs organized)
    - Search Strategy (Hugo built-in vs. external)
    - Future Extensions (version management, multi-language, etc.)
  repository_structure:
    layout: 'Design the directory structure for the docsite within the repository.

      Balance separation of concerns with ease of maintenance.

    deliverable: docs-site/README.md (setup instructions)
  initial_setup:
    tasks:
    - Select and configure Hugo theme (community theme, not corporate yet)
    - Create initial Hugo configuration (config.toml)
    - Set up content directories
    - Create homepage content skeleton (docs-site/content/_index.md)
    - Create section index pages (_index.md for each main section)
    - Document local development workflow (how to run hugo server)
    - Prepare handoff task for build-automation (GitHub Actions deployment)
  decision_points:
    metadata_strategy:
      question: Adopt ADR-022 separated metadata pattern now, or standard front matter?
      recommendation: Defer to standard front matter for Batch 1-4; adopt separated
        metadata in Batch 5 if desired (optional optimization)
      rationale: Simplifies initial implementation; separated metadata can be added
        later without content changes if using symlinks
    theme_choice:
      question: Which Hugo theme for Batch 1-4 (before corporate theme)?
      recommendations:
      - Hugo Book theme (clean, documentation-focused, widely used)
      - Docsy theme (feature-rich, Google-maintained, good for large doc sites)
      - Learn theme (tutorial-focused, good for onboarding content)
      evaluation: 'Select based on: ease of customization, corporate theme migration
        path, community support'
    versioning:
      question: Set up multi-version support now or later?
      recommendation: Single version initially; plan for version branches when needed
        (Batch 5 or post-launch)
      rationale: Simpler initial setup; framework versioning not critical yet; can
        add later

  - Theme renders properly (homepage displays correctly)
  - Directory structure follows planned architecture
  documentation:

estimated_effort: 6-8 hours
timeline:
  start: ASAP (no blockers)
  completion: Within 1 week
  next_batch_start: After deployment workflow complete (build-automation handoff)
notes: 'This task establishes the foundation for a multi-batch documentation website
  initiative.

  Focus on:

  1. Solid technical foundation (correct choices, extensible architecture)

  2. Clear documentation (enable others to contribute)

  3. Smooth handoffs (next agents have what they need)


  Don''t over-engineer Batch 1:

  - Simple theme choice (corporate theme comes in Batch 5)

  - Standard front matter (separated metadata optional for later)

  - Single version (multi-version when needed)


  The goal is working foundation that enables content creation in Batches 2-4.

  '
risks:
- risk: Hugo theme incompatible with corporate theme (Batch 5)
  mitigation: Choose theme with similar structure; design for theme swap; focus on
    content portability
  probability: LOW
  impact: MEDIUM
- risk: Site structure doesn't scale as content grows
  mitigation: Design with growth in mind; review structure with experienced users;
    reference large Hugo doc sites
  probability: LOW
  impact: HIGH
- risk: Handoff tasks not clear enough for next agents
  mitigation: Provide detailed task specifications; clear prerequisites; reference
    this architecture doc
  probability: MEDIUM
  impact: MEDIUM

result:
  summary: 'Established complete technical foundation for documentation website. Hugo

    and initialized with Book theme. Build performance exceeds targets (85ms vs 5s

    target). Created 15 files including architecture docs, site config, homepage,
    and

    5 section placeholders. Generated 3 handoff tasks for follow-up work.

    score: 8.1/11 (vs Jekyll 5.2/11)
    rationale:
    - Build performance: 85ms (50-100x faster)
    - Zero dependencies (single binary)
    - Corporate theme available
    - Active maintenance and community
  build_performance:
    current: 85ms for 18 pages

    total_size: ~3MB
  next_steps:
  - Build automation: GitHub Actions deployment (4-6h, HIGH priority)
  - Content migration: Plan migration of 19 HOW_TO_USE guides (4-6h, MEDIUM)
  - Diagrams: Architecture visualizations (2-3h, OPTIONAL)
  impact: 'Foundation complete for 10-14 week documentation website initiative. Enables

    professional GitHub Pages site, improved framework adoption, and 40% support
