  summary: |
    Comprehensive research completed on Ralph Wiggum loop pattern. Key findings:
    1. "Ralph Wiggum loop" is original terminology (not found in existing literature)
    2. Strong academic foundation exists in meta-cognition, MAPE-K, and BDI architectures
    3. Our implementation aligns excellently with best practices
    4. Recommendation: Proceed with current design, add formal terminology alias
    5. No significant changes needed; minor refinements suggested
  
  findings:
    terminology:
      established_term: false
      similar_patterns:
        - "Meta-cognition / Meta-reasoning (Cox, 2005)"
        - "MAPE-K Loop (Kephart & Chess, 2003)"
        - "BDI Intention Reconsideration (Rao & Georgeff, 1995)"
        - "Reflexion Framework (Shinn et al., 2023)"
      recommendation: "Dual naming: 'Ralph Wiggum Loop' (internal), 'Self-Observation Protocol' (external)"
    
    best_practices:
      checkpoint_timing: "Hybrid (time-based + progress-based + event-driven) — ALIGNED ✅"
      checklist_design: "5-9 items, actionable (Gawande, 2009) — ALIGNED ✅ (8 items)"
      decision_levels: "3-tier response (green/yellow/red) — ALIGNED ✅"

        - "Cox Metacognitive Loop — theoretical foundation"
        - "AutoGen checkpoints — practical but less structured"
      novelty: "Our implementation is unique synthesis: directive-driven + LLM agents + work log integration"
    
    failure_modes:
      identified:
        - "Observer effect (checkpoint disrupts flow)"
