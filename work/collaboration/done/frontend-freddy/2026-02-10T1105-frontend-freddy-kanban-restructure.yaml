  finished work section by default with expandable toggle.

  - "Finished work section is scrollable (max-height: 400px)"
  - "BLOCKED task styling: red border, red background, ⚠️ icon"

  - Use .hidden class for default collapsed state
  - Add .task-blocked class for blocked task styling

files_to_modify:

  - src/llm_service/dashboard/static/dashboard.css

Moved "Done" and "Error" columns into a collapsible ".finished-work-section" (hidden by default) with a "Show Finished Work" toggle button. Implemented BLOCKED task styling with red borders and warning icons. All ARIA accessibility attributes added. Responsive layout extended for mobile viewports.
