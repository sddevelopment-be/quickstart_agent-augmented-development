title: Publish release/upgrade documentation and checklist aligned to iteration workflow
description: 'Produce the documentation set that teaches downstream teams how to consume
  the

  packaged release, run Framework Guardian, and coordinate via the

  run-iteration workflow. Content should reference ADR-013/ADR-014 decisions,

  list prerequisites, and include a Guardian-ready publishing checklist.

artefacts:
- docs/HOW_TO_USE/release_and_upgrade.md
- docs/checklists/release_publishing_checklist.md
- docs/templates/RELEASE_NOTES.md (update)
context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main

  notes:
  - Coordinate with Guardian + build-automation tasks to keep instructions accurate.
  - Document how Manager Mike should reference these docs during iteration summaries.
  - Cross-link `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` and `work/collaboration/AGENT_STATUS.md`.
requirements:
- Document end-to-end release workflow (package build, install/upgrade, Guardian validation).
- Provide quickstart and deep-dive sections with clear prerequisites + commands.
- Build checklist covering artefact verification, script invocation, log capture,
  comms.
- Refresh release notes template to include Guardian + distribution metadata fields.
- Highlight iteration hooks (when to run template-status-checker, how to log metrics).
testing_requirements:
- Run doc clarity pass with Curator guidelines.
- Validate instructions by shadowing packaging/install task owners (tabletop review).
- Ensure Markdown passes Vale/lint checks if configured.

  summary: 'Created comprehensive release documentation suite covering complete workflow
    from build to Guardian validation. Produced three artifacts: (1) Release and

    managers), (3) RELEASE_NOTES.md template (13KB, with Guardian and distribution
