title: Write comprehensive user guide for framework distribution and installation

description: |
  Create user-friendly documentation that explains how to distribute, install, and
  upgrade the Quickstart Agent-Augmented Development Framework. The guide should
  target downstream teams and individual developers who want to adopt the framework.
  
  This documentation should complement the existing technical documentation by
  focusing on user experience, common scenarios, and troubleshooting.

artefacts:
  - docs/USER_GUIDE_distribution.md
  - docs/USER_GUIDE_installation.md
  - docs/USER_GUIDE_upgrade.md
  - docs/quickstart/GETTING_STARTED.md (enhance existing or create)

context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: copilot/run-orchestration-cycle
  related_tasks:
    - 2025-12-05T1010-build-automation-release-packaging-pipeline (completed)
    - 2025-12-05T1012-build-automation-install-upgrade-scripts (completed)
  notes:
    - Base content on existing technical docs in docs/HOW_TO_USE/framework_install.md
    - Transform technical specs into user-friendly narrative
    - Include step-by-step tutorials with expected output examples
    - Address common questions and gotchas
    - Add visual aids (diagrams, screenshots if applicable)
    - Target audience: Developers and team leads adopting the framework
    - Follow Directive 022 (Audience-Oriented Writing)

requirements:
  user_guide_distribution:
    - Explain what gets distributed (artifacts, structure, profiles)
    - Describe the four distribution profiles (full, minimal, documentation, platform_exports)
    - Clarify when to use each profile
    - Explain included export directories (.claude, .opencode) and their purpose
    - Provide examples of building releases locally and via CI/CD
    - Include troubleshooting section for common build issues
  
  user_guide_installation:
    - Step-by-step walkthrough for first-time installation
    - Prerequisites and system requirements
    - What to expect during installation (file counts, structure)
    - Verification steps to confirm successful installation
    - Common installation scenarios (empty repo, existing project)
    - What NOT to do (common mistakes)
  
  user_guide_upgrade:
    - Explain upgrade workflow and safety mechanisms
    - How conflict detection works (checksums, .framework-new files)
    - Step-by-step upgrade process with examples
    - How to handle conflicts (review, merge, reject)
    - Backup and rollback procedures
    - Upgrade planning with --plan mode
    - Protected directories and preservation rules
  
  getting_started:
    - Quick start for impatient users (5-minute setup)
    - "Hello World" equivalent for framework adoption
    - First task creation and execution
    - Next steps and learning path
    - Links to deeper documentation

style_guidelines:
  - Conversational but professional tone
  - Short paragraphs, bullet points where appropriate
  - Use "you" to address the reader directly
  - Provide context before commands
  - Show example output after commands
  - Use callout boxes for warnings/tips/notes
  - Progressive disclosure (start simple, add complexity gradually)
  - Real-world scenarios and use cases

testing_requirements:
  - Have a non-technical team member review for clarity
  - Test all command examples
  - Validate that documentation can be followed without prior knowledge
  - Ensure consistency with technical documentation
  - Check that all links work

dependencies:
  - docs/HOW_TO_USE/framework_install.md (technical reference)
  - ops/release/README.md (build system docs)
  - ops/release/distribution-config.yaml (configuration reference)
  - work/collaboration/ITERATION_2026-01-31_SUMMARY.md (context)
