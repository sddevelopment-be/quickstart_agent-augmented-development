title: Agent Specialization Hierarchy - Orchestrate Implementation
artefacts:
  - work/collaboration/inbox/*.yaml (individual phase tasks)
  - work/coordination/AGENT_STATUS.md
  - work/coordination/WORKFLOW_LOG.md
context:
  background: |
    Agent Specialization Hierarchy ready for implementation.
    Roadmap updated with 6 phases (54-68 hours total).

    Need to create individual tasks for each phase and assign to appropriate agents.

    Reference documents:
    - Architecture Design: docs/architecture/design/agent-specialization-hierarchy.md
    - DDR-011: doctrine/decisions/DDR-011-agent-specialization-hierarchy.md
    - Specification: specifications/features/agent-specialization-hierarchy.md
    - Roadmap: work/planning/roadmap/ROADMAP.md (from Petra)

  milestone: 'Agent Orchestration Enhancement'
  strategic_value: |
    Coordinate multi-agent implementation effort.
    Track progress across 6 phases.
    Ensure quality gates between phases.

requirements:
  task_creation:
    - Create tasks for each deliverable in 6 phases
    - Assign tasks to appropriate specialist agents:
        * Phase 1 (Glossary): curator-claire
        * Phase 2 (Tactic): architect-alphonso, python-pedro (implementation)
        * Phase 3 (Schema): curator-claire, python-pedro
        * Phase 4 (Manager Mike): python-pedro, backend-benny
        * Phase 5 (Testing): python-pedro, backend-benny
        * Phase 6 (Documentation): scribe-sally, curator-claire

  orchestration_planning:
    - Determine phase sequencing (sequential vs parallel)
    - Identify handoff points between agents
    - Define quality gates (validation checkpoints)
    - Plan phase review meetings (human approval before next phase)

  status_tracking:
    - Update AGENT_STATUS.md with initiative start
    - Create workflow log entries for kickoff
    - Set up monitoring for task completion
    - Define success metrics for each phase

  coordination:
    - Notify assigned agents of new tasks
    - Track dependencies between tasks
    - Manage handoffs between phases
    - Escalate blockers to human stakeholder

acceptance_criteria:
  - Tasks created for all 6 phases (15-20 individual tasks estimated)
  - Each task includes:
      * Clear acceptance criteria
      * Assigned agent (specialist appropriate for work)
      * Dependencies (blocked by previous tasks)
      * Estimated effort
      * Priority (critical path vs parallel work)
  - AGENT_STATUS.md updated with initiative kickoff
  - WORKFLOW_LOG.md entry created for orchestration start
  - Phase 1 tasks ready to start immediately
  - Phase 2-6 tasks in inbox, blocked on Phase 1 completion
  - Quality gates defined (validation before next phase)
  - Human review points identified (after Phase 2, 4, 5)

dependencies:
  - DDR-011 (completed)
  - Architecture design (completed)
  - Functional specification (from Analyst Annie)
  - Roadmap update (from Planning Petra)
