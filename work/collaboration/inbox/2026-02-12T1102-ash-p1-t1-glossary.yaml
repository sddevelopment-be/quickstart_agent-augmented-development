title: 'Task 1: GLOSSARY.md Hierarchy Terminology Update'
description: |
  Add 7 new terms to doctrine/GLOSSARY.md related to Agent Specialization Hierarchy:

  1. Agent Specialization Hierarchy - Parent-child relationship where specialized agents refine their parent's scope to narrower contexts
  2. Parent Agent - Generalist agent whose collaboration contract and capabilities are inherited by specialist children
  3. Child Agent / Specialist Agent - Agent that inherits parent's contract but operates in narrower specialization context
  4. Specialization Context - Declarative conditions defining when specialist preferred over parent
  5. Routing Priority - Numeric specificity score (0-100) for specialist agents
  6. Reassignment Pass - Manager Mike process that reviews existing task assignments and upgrades to specialists
  7. SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT - Orchestration tactic determining most appropriate agent for a task

  Each term must include definition, example, and cross-references to DDR-011 and architecture design.
  Follow existing glossary format and style. Ensure no conflicts with existing terminology.
