title: 'Task 3: Architecture Design Review and Validation'
description: |
  Review existing architecture design document (docs/architecture/design/agent-specialization-hierarchy.md)
  and validate alignment with DDR-011, specification SPEC-ASH-001, tactic document, and GLOSSARY.md updates.

  Review checklist:
  1. Domain model consistent across all documents
  2. Routing algorithm specification matches architecture design
  3. Agent profile schema changes documented consistently
  4. Phase breakdown in architecture matches roadmap plan
  5. Success metrics aligned across documents
  6. No contradictions or conflicts found

  If misalignments found: identify issues, determine resolution approach, update architecture design
  if needed, document validation results in work log.

  Deliverable: Validation report confirming alignment or documenting resolutions made.

artefacts:
- work/reports/logs/architect/2026-02-12-ash-architecture-validation.md
- docs/architecture/design/agent-specialization-hierarchy.md

context:
  background: Multiple documents created for Agent Specialization Hierarchy (DDR-011, architecture design, specification, tactic). Need validation pass to ensure consistency and catch any contradictions before implementation starts.
  milestone: ASH Phase 1 - Core Decision & Glossary
  strategic_value: Validation prevents implementation issues caused by contradictory specifications. Ensures all documents reflect same design intent.

  architecture_design: docs/architecture/design/agent-specialization-hierarchy.md
  decision_record: doctrine/decisions/DDR-011-agent-specialization-hierarchy.md

requirements:
- Review architecture design document thoroughly
- Cross-check domain model against DDR-011 and specification
- Verify routing algorithm details match across documents
- Validate agent profile schema changes consistent
- Check phase breakdown matches roadmap
- Verify success metrics aligned
- Document any misalignments found
- Resolve conflicts or flag for discussion
- Update architecture design if corrections needed
- Create validation report in work log

acceptance_criteria:
- Architecture design document reviewed completely
- Validation report created documenting findings
- All critical misalignments resolved or escalated
- Domain model consistency confirmed
- Routing algorithm specification consistency confirmed
- Agent profile schema consistency confirmed
- Success metrics alignment confirmed
- Architecture design marked with review date (2026-02-12)
- Work log entry documents validation process and results
