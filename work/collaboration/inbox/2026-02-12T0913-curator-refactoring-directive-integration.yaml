# Task: Integrate Refactoring Tactics into Directives and Index

## Context

New tactics must be discoverable and invoked from directives rather than embedded procedurally in directive prose.

## Objective

Update refactoring-related directives and `doctrine/tactics/README.md` to integrate newly created tactics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Relevant directive(s) reference new tactics explicitly.
- [ ] `doctrine/tactics/README.md` includes new entries.
- [ ] Cross-links resolve and respect doctrine dependency/boundary rules.
- [ ] No override conflict with General/Operational guidelines.

## Deliverables

- Updated directive file(s)
- Updated `doctrine/tactics/README.md`
