title: "Create Spec-Driven Development PRIMER Document"
artefacts:
  - .github/agents/approaches/spec-driven-development.md
context:
  background: |
    Translate spec-kitty's spec-driven.md methodology into a PRIMER document 
    for our approach directory. Ties in closely with existing ATDD directive 
    (016) but from a process/architectural point of view.
  source_reference: docs/architecture/design/comparative_study/references/spec-kitty-spec-driven.md
  related_directive: .github/agents/directives/016_acceptance_test_driven_dev.md
  target_audience: All agents (especially Alphonso and Petra)
  comparative_analysis: docs/architecture/design/comparative_study/2026-02-05-spec-kitty-comparative-analysis.md
requirements:
  approach_document:
    - Explain Specification-Driven Development methodology
    - How it differs from and complements ATDD
    - When to use specifications vs. acceptance tests
    - Integration with our workflow patterns
  structure:
    - Purpose section
    - Core principles
    - When to use guidance
    - Example prompts
    - Metadata (capabilities, tags)
  adaptation:
    - Adapt spec-kitty patterns to our context
    - Reference our existing approaches (ATDD, Decision-First Dev)
    - Include cross-references to directives
    - Highlight differences from spec-kitty's approach
  integration:
    - How SDD fits into our file-based orchestration
    - When to create specifications during planning phase
    - Specification formats and templates
    - Relationship to ADRs and acceptance criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - PRIMER document follows our approach template
  - Clear differentiation between SDD and ATDD explained
  - Practical examples for agent usage
  - Cross-references to relevant directives (016, 018, 034)
  - Metadata properly formatted
  - Document placed in .github/agents/approaches/
  - References spec-kitty analysis and original source

notes: |
  This task supports the creation of Directive 034 (Spec-Driven Development)
  which will formalize spec-driven practices across the framework.
  
  Key distinctions from spec-kitty:
  - We use YAML task files for orchestration (not just specs)
  - Our ADRs serve a different role than their specs
  - We have stronger ATDD integration (Directive 016)
  
  The PRIMER should help agents understand WHEN to write specifications
  vs. when to write ADRs vs. when to write acceptance tests.
