title: Define Framework Guardian agent profile, templates, and validation hooks

description: |
  Materialize the Framework Guardian role described in ADR-014 so future
  iterations can enforce release integrity. Deliver a `.agent.md` profile,
  supporting directives/templates, and validation checklists that slot directly
  into file-based orchestration (Manager Mike’s run-iteration template).

artefacts:
  - .github/agents/framework-guardian.agent.md
  - .github/agents/directives/0XX_framework_guardian.md
  - docs/templates/GUARDIAN_AUDIT_REPORT.md
  - docs/templates/GUARDIAN_UPGRADE_PLAN.md
  - work/collaboration/AGENT_STATUS.md (update guardian row)

context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  related_pr: ''
  notes:
    - Align tone + responsibilities with operational guidelines and AGENTS.md.
    - Document how Guardian hooks into packaging + install tasks during iterations.
    - Ensure templates capture metadata needed for ADR coverage + release metrics.
    - Provide instructions for invoking Guardian during `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` cycles.

requirements:
  - Draft agent profile detailing purpose, authorities, required directives.
  - Create Guardian-specific directive capturing audit workflow + escalation markers.
  - Provide Markdown templates for audit report + upgrade plan, referencing release artefacts.
  - Update AGENT_STATUS to include Guardian readiness + contact cadence.
  - Describe how Guardian outputs integrate with work logs + iteration summaries.

testing_requirements:
  - Peer review via Curator Claire checklist (include as acceptance note).
  - Dry-run template fill using sample data from packaging pipeline.
  - Validate directive numbering + manifest entries (Directive 006).

dependencies:
  - docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_architecture.md
  - .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md
