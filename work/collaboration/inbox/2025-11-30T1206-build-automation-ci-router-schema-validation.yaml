title: Wire router + task-schema validators into CI workflows

artefacts:
  - .github/workflows/validation.yml
  - .github/workflows/orchestration.yml
  - work/logs/build-automation/2025-11-30T1206-build-automation-ci-router-schema-validation.md

description: |
  Update CI so router config validation and enhanced task schema checks are run
  automatically, fulfilling the enforcement requirement in Platform Next Steps.

context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  source_assessment: docs/architecture/assessments/platform_next_steps.md
  notes:
    - Trigger the new ops/scripts/validate-model-router.py script.
    - Extend validation/validate-task-schema.py to assert presence of model
      selection hints and integrate it into CI job(s).
    - Provide matrix or caching considerations if runtime costs increase.

requirements:
  - Update validation.yml to install prerequisites (Python deps) and run the
    router validator plus task schema check (covering inbox + assigned directories).
  - If orchestration.yml also needs guardrails, add quick smoke checks there or
    document rationale in the PR description/work log.
  - Ensure failure output is readable and includes remediation hints.
  - Capture before/after job run logs in work log.

success_criteria:
  - CI pipelines fail when router config or task schema is invalid.
  - Work log documents job changes, runtime impact, and follow-up needs.
  - No regressions to existing validation jobs (cross-check with template status checker).
