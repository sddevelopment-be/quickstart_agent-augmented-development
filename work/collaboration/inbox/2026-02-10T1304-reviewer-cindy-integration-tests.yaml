title: "Task 2.3: Write integration tests for Claude Code deployment"
description: >
  Create tests/integration/deploy-claude-code.test.js with comprehensive integration tests.
  Test full deployment produces all expected artifacts (CLAUDE.md, 5 rules files, simplified agents).
  Test line count limits (CLAUDE.md <120, rules <80, agents <40). Test idempotency (deploy
  twice → identical output). Test selective deployment flags (--rules, --claude-md, --agents).
  Test .claude/prompts/ not created by default. Test backward compatibility of existing
  --claude, --copilot, --opencode flags. All tests must use temporary directories.
  See technical design section 4.
