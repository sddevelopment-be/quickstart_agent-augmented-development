title: "Task 1.3: Implement generateClaudeMd() in claude-code-generator.js"
description: >
  Implement generateClaudeMd(config) function that composes CLAUDE.md from multiple doctrine
  source files. Extract purpose from docs/VISION.md, directory structure from directive 003,
  conventions from python-conventions.md. Add hardcoded common commands section. Add pointers
  to deeper context. Enforce 120-line limit. Graceful degradation when source files missing.
  Include generation header comment.
  See technical design section 2.1 generateClaudeMd.
