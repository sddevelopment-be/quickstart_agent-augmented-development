  - Orphan tasks section (tasks without spec links)
  - Real-time WebSocket updates when tasks complete
  - Responsive design (desktop + tablet)

  - MODIFY: src/llm_service/dashboard/static/dashboard.js (portfolio rendering)
  - MODIFY: src/llm_service/dashboard/static/dashboard.css (portfolio styles)
