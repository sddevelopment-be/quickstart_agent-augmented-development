title: Produce multi-tier runtime diagrams-as-code

description: |
  Create the PlantUML/Mermaid diagrams requested in Platform Next Steps to
  visualize Layers 0-3 (human interface through model execution) using C4
  notation and reference them from architectural_vision.md plus ADR-020/021.

context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  source_assessment: docs/architecture/assessments/platform_next_steps.md
  notes:
    - Provide both PlantUML and Mermaid variants if practical; at minimum
      deliver the format best suited for docs pipeline (Mermaid recommended).
    - Show router fallback flows and local worker offload points.
    - Include legend + callouts hooking back to ADR numbers.

requirements:
  - Author docs/architecture/diagrams/multi_tier_runtime.mmd describing the
    runtime tiers and data flows, using semantic IDs and C4 conventions.
  - If needed, add PlantUML counterpart (.puml) for offline rendering
    referencing the same structure.
  - Update docs/architecture/architectural_vision.md and ADR-020/ADR-021 to
    embed the diagrams (or add includes) once merged.
  - Document diagram generation instructions in the work log.

success_criteria:
  - Diagrams render locally (Mermaid preview or PlantUML export) without errors.
  - Architecture docs reference the diagram anchors.
  - Work log captures key decisions and any assumptions needing validation.
