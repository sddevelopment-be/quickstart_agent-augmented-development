title: Agent Specialization Hierarchy - Roadmap Integration
artefacts:
  - work/planning/roadmap/ROADMAP.md
  - work/planning/PLAN_OVERVIEW.md
  - work/planning/NEXT_BATCH.md
context:
  background: |
    Agent Specialization Hierarchy approved for implementation.
    Need to integrate into repository roadmap with phased approach.

    Total implementation effort: 54-68 hours across 6 phases

    Reference documents:
    - Architecture Design: docs/architecture/design/agent-specialization-hierarchy.md
    - DDR-011: doctrine/decisions/DDR-011-agent-specialization-hierarchy.md
    - Specification: specifications/features/agent-specialization-hierarchy.md (from Annie)

  milestone: 'Agent Orchestration Enhancement'
  strategic_value: |
    Foundation for intelligent multi-agent routing.
    Enables 10+ future specialist agents (React, Vue, Payment Processing, etc.).
    Improves developer experience for repository adopters.

requirements:
  roadmap_integration:
    - Add "Agent Specialization Hierarchy" initiative to roadmap
    - Break down into 6 phases (per architecture design)
    - Estimate effort per phase (6-16h per phase)
    - Identify dependencies between phases
    - Propose timeline (sequential vs partial parallel)

  phase_breakdown:
    phase_1:
      title: "Core Decision & Glossary"
      effort: "6-8 hours"
      deliverables:
        - DDR-011 (already completed)
        - GLOSSARY.md updates (new terminology)
      dependencies: []

    phase_2:
      title: "SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT Tactic"
      effort: "10-12 hours"
      deliverables:
        - doctrine/tactics/SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT.tactic.md
        - Python reference implementation (tools/orchestration/agent_selector.py)
      dependencies: ["Phase 1"]

    phase_3:
      title: "Agent Profile Schema Enhancement"
      effort: "8-10 hours"
      deliverables:
        - Updated agent profile template
        - Python Pedro, Java Jenny, Backend Benny profile updates
        - Validation script (tools/validators/validate-agent-hierarchy.py)
      dependencies: ["Phase 1"]

    phase_4:
      title: "Manager Mike Enhancement"
      effort: "10-12 hours"
      deliverables:
        - Updated Manager Mike profile
        - Handoff protocol enhancement implementation
        - Reassignment pass implementation
      dependencies: ["Phase 2", "Phase 3"]

    phase_5:
      title: "Validation & Testing"
      effort: "12-16 hours"
      deliverables:
        - Unit tests (routing algorithm)
        - Integration tests (end-to-end flows)
        - Test scenarios (12+ test cases)
      dependencies: ["Phase 2", "Phase 3", "Phase 4"]

    phase_6:
      title: "Documentation & Migration"
      effort: "8-10 hours"
      deliverables:
        - Migration guide
        - Repository adopter guide
        - Decision tree diagram
      dependencies: ["Phase 5"]

  capacity_planning:
    - Identify available specialist agents (Python Pedro, Backend Benny, DevOps Danny, etc.)
    - Estimate concurrent capacity (avoid specialist overload during implementation)
    - Propose batch groupings (which phases can run in parallel)

  risk_assessment:
    - Identify implementation risks (circular deps, routing bugs, migration disruption)
    - Propose mitigation strategies
    - Define rollback plan if issues emerge

acceptance_criteria:
  - ROADMAP.md updated with Agent Specialization Hierarchy initiative
  - All 6 phases documented with effort estimates and dependencies
  - PLAN_OVERVIEW.md reflects new initiative
  - NEXT_BATCH.md proposes starting phase (Phase 1 likely already done)
  - Timeline proposed (sequential vs overlapping phases)
  - Capacity plan identifies agent assignments per phase
  - Risk assessment included with mitigation strategies
  - Handoff to Manager Mike for task creation

dependencies:
  - DDR-011 (completed)
  - Architecture design (completed)
  - Functional specification (from Analyst Annie)
