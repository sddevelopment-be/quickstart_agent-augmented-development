title: Publish release/upgrade documentation and checklist aligned to iteration workflow

description: |
  Produce the documentation set that teaches downstream teams how to consume the
  packaged release, run Framework Guardian, and coordinate via the
  run-iteration workflow. Content should reference ADR-013/ADR-014 decisions,
  list prerequisites, and include a Guardian-ready publishing checklist.

artefacts:
  - docs/HOW_TO_USE/release_and_upgrade.md
  - docs/checklists/release_publishing_checklist.md
  - docs/templates/RELEASE_NOTES.md (update)

context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  related_pr: ''
  notes:
    - Coordinate with Guardian + build-automation tasks to keep instructions accurate.
    - Document how Manager Mike should reference these docs during iteration summaries.
    - Cross-link `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md` and `work/collaboration/AGENT_STATUS.md`.

requirements:
  - Document end-to-end release workflow (package build, install/upgrade, Guardian validation).
  - Provide quickstart and deep-dive sections with clear prerequisites + commands.
  - Build checklist covering artefact verification, script invocation, log capture, comms.
  - Refresh release notes template to include Guardian + distribution metadata fields.
  - Highlight iteration hooks (when to run template-status-checker, how to log metrics).

testing_requirements:
  - Run doc clarity pass with Curator guidelines.
  - Validate instructions by shadowing packaging/install task owners (tabletop review).
  - Ensure Markdown passes Vale/lint checks if configured.

dependencies:
  - 2025-12-05T1010-build-automation-release-packaging-pipeline
  - 2025-12-05T1012-build-automation-install-upgrade-scripts
