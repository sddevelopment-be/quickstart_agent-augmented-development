  - .github/agents/directives/019_file_based_collaboration.md
  - .github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/ (new directory)
  - .github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/README.md (overview)

  branch: "copilot/restructure-work-directory"
  notes:
    - "HIGHLY verbose directive - will lead to bad token discipline"
    - "Extract step-by-step information to .github/agents/approaches/file_based_collaboration/"
    - "Use headers as natural splits - create one file per step"
    - "Add general overview in README-style page with references to different steps"
    - "Directive should tell agents to adhere to approach and point to automation scripts"
    - "Keep it minimal - explicitly tell agents to load only task-phase relevant information"
    - "Allows agents to keep only currently needed information in memory"
