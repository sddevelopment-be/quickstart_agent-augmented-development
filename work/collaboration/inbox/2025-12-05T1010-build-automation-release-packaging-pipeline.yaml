title: Build release packaging pipeline for quickstart artefact

description: |
  Implement the CI-friendly packaging pipeline described in ADR-013/ADR-014 so
  `quickstart-framework-<version>.zip` is produced with checksums, manifests,
  and Guardian metadata on every tagged release candidate. Follow the design
  notes inside `docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_*.md` and the
  iteration guardrails in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/run-iteration.md`. The script
  must be orchestrator-aware (file-based workflow) and emit artefacts that can
  be consumed by Framework Guardian automation.

artefacts:
  - ops/release/build_release_artifact.py
  - ops/release/README.md
  - .github/workflows/release-packaging.yml
  - docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_architecture.md

context:
  repo: sddevelopment-be/quickstart_agent-augmented-development
  branch: main
  related_pr: ''
  notes:
    - Pipeline must run inside GitHub Actions and locally via `just release`.
    - Package needs manifest (component inventory), checksums, and metadata.json.
    - Reference `work/reports/logs/architect/2025-11-24T2105-distribution-release-architecture.md`.
    - Ensure outputs register in `work/reports/logs/` for iteration summaries.

requirements:
  - Add build script that assembles the release directory then zips with version tag.
  - Generate manifest + checksum files that Guardian scripts will later validate.
  - Update release workflow to run build script, store artefact, and upload to releases.
  - Provide configuration knobs (e.g., include/exclude docs) documented in README.
  - Integrate with file-based orchestration so tasks can be verified via run-iteration template.
  - Document failure modes and troubleshooting steps.

testing_requirements:
  - Add unit tests for packaging helpers (manifest generation, checksum calc).
  - Add integration test that runs the build script and validates produced structure.
  - Provide CI smoke test (workflow job) to block merges when packaging fails.
  - Follow directives 016/017 (ATDD/TDD) and capture work logs per Directive 014.

dependencies:
  - docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_architecture.md
  - docs/architecture/design/distribution_of_releases_technical_design.md
