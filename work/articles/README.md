# Articles Directory

This directory collects public-friendly articles and summaries about agent-enhanced development and test readability. It provides a single place to publish and share narrative writeups (for managers, educators, coaches, and engineers) without mixing them into the core architecture or template docs under `docs/`.

Use this folder for:
- Audience-specific articles and explainers
- Case-study style summaries of experiments
- Manager- or educator-oriented narratives

Keep technical templates and architecture references in `docs/`; keep polished articles here for sharing and reuse.
