# Code as Documentation Experiment Articles

Purpose: Public-friendly articles and summaries about the test readability experiment and agent-enhanced development.

What belongs: Audience-specific articles (coaches/engineers, managers, educators) and related narratives.  
What doesn’t: Core architecture docs (keep under `docs/`), working drafts (use `work/notes/`).
