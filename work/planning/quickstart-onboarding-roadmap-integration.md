# Quickstart & Onboarding - Roadmap Integration

**Initiative:** Quickstart & Onboarding  
**Planner:** Planning Petra  
**Date:** 2026-02-10  
**Type:** Roadmap Integration Document

---

## Roadmap Positioning

### Initiative Priority: HIGH

**Strategic Importance:**
- **Adoption Enabler:** Removes primary barrier to framework adoption
- **Quality Multiplier:** Ensures best practices from day 1
- **Time Saver:** 85% reduction in setup time (hours → <15 minutes)
- **Support Reducer:** Self-service setup reduces support burden

**Relative Priority:**
```
CRITICAL: Dashboard Enhancements (real-time tracking, portfolio view)
HIGH:     Framework Distribution (multi-tool export)
HIGH:     Quickstart & Onboarding ← NEW
HIGH:     Src Consolidation (code quality)
```

## Resource Commitment

### Core Team (8 weeks)

**Bootstrap Bill:**
- Lead implementer
- 80% allocation Weeks 1-2
- 20-50% allocation Weeks 3-7
- 30% allocation Week 8

**Python Pedro:**
- Wizard developer
- 80% allocation Weeks 3-4
- 50-70% allocation Weeks 5-6
- 20-30% allocation Weeks 7-8

**DevOps Danny:**
- Script review and CI
- 20% allocation Weeks 1-2

**Writer-Editor:**
- Documentation
- 60% allocation Week 7

**Manager Mike:**
- Coordination and launch
- 40% allocation Week 8

---

## Dependencies & Sequencing

### Upstream (Must Complete First)
- ✅ **DONE:** Doctrine framework extraction
- ✅ **DONE:** Bootstrap Bill agent profile
- ✅ **DONE:** Conceptual Alignment initiative (glossary structure)
- ✅ **DONE:** Specifications complete

### Parallel Execution
- **Can Run Parallel:** Dashboard Enhancements (different teams)
- **Can Run Parallel:** Framework Distribution (after Batch 1 complete)
- **Should Defer:** Src Consolidation (wait until after Q1)

### Downstream (Enabled By This)
- Getting-started guide agent full implementation
- Repository template marketplace
- CI/CD template generation
- Enhanced onboarding documentation

---

## Milestones & Gates

### Milestone 1: Core Script Functional (End Week 2)
**Deliverable:** init-repository.sh works in automated mode  
**Gate:** Must pass automated tests and validation  
**Risk:** If fails, wizard development delayed

---

### Milestone 2: Wizard Foundation Complete (End Week 4)
**Deliverable:** Interactive wizard end-to-end flow  
**Gate:** Must complete user acceptance testing  
**Risk:** If UX poor, requires iteration (adds 1 week)

---

### Milestone 3: Testing & Documentation Complete (End Week 7)
**Deliverable:** Production-ready with comprehensive docs  
**Gate:** >80% test coverage, docs reviewed  
**Risk:** If quality low, launch delayed

---

### Milestone 4: Soft Launch Success (End Week 8)
**Deliverable:** 5+ teams successfully initialize repos  
**Gate:** >80% user satisfaction, <5 critical bugs  
**Risk:** If low adoption, requires marketing push

---

## Success Criteria (Revisited)

### Launch Success (Week 8)
- ✅ 5+ teams complete initialization successfully
- ✅ Average setup time <15 minutes
- ✅ User satisfaction >80% ("easy to use")
- ✅ <5 critical bugs reported
- ✅ All documentation complete and accurate

### 3-Month Success (End Q2)
- ✅ 20+ repositories initialized
- ✅ 90% include non-default vision documents
- ✅ 80% include project-specific glossary terms
- ✅ Support requests <5% of initializations
- ✅ Feature requests collected for Phase 2

### 6-Month Success (End Q3)
- ✅ 50+ repositories using framework
- ✅ Setup time consistently <15 minutes
- ✅ New agent profiles reference init process
- ✅ Community contributions (templates, improvements)
- ✅ Phase 2 features prioritized and planned

---

## Budget & Investment

### Time Investment
- **Development:** 55 story points × 4 hours/point = 220 hours
- **Testing:** Included in development estimate
- **Documentation:** 40 hours
- **Management:** 20 hours
- **Total:** ~280 hours (~7 person-weeks)

### Expected Return
- **Time Saved Per Repo:** 2-4 hours → 15 minutes = 105-225 minutes saved
- **50 repos in 6 months:** 87-187 hours saved
- **ROI:** 31-67% return in first 6 months
- **Long-term:** Every repo saves time, compounds over years

### Opportunity Cost
- Deferring Src Consolidation by 1 month (acceptable)
- Delaying Phase 2 enhancements for other initiatives

## Risk Management Summary

### High Risks
1. **Scope Creep:** Mitigate with strict spec adherence
2. **Low Adoption:** Mitigate with strong marketing and docs
3. **Cross-Platform Issues:** Mitigate with early platform testing

### Medium Risks
1. **Python Dependencies:** Document clearly, provide bash fallback
2. **Agent Integration Timing:** Build as optional feature
3. **UX Complexity:** Test with real users early

### Low Risks
1. **Team Availability:** Core team committed
2. **Technical Feasibility:** Well-understood technologies
3. **Template Maintenance:** Automated reference to doctrine/

## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### Go Criteria (All Must Be True)
- ✅ Specifications approved by Architect Alphonso
- ✅ Resource commitment confirmed (Bill, Pedro, Danny, etc.)
- ✅ Timeline acceptable to stakeholders
- ✅ Dependencies satisfied (doctrine extracted, etc.)
- ✅ Success metrics agreed upon

### No-Go Criteria (Any Triggers Delay)
- ❌ Core team unavailable (>50% capacity)
- ❌ Competing CRITICAL priority emerges
- ❌ Technical blocker discovered (e.g., template unavailable)
- ❌ Budget/resource constraints
- ❌ Stakeholder veto

---

## Recommendation

**Status:** ✅ **RECOMMEND GO**

**Rationale:**
1. **Strategic Value:** High impact on adoption and quality
2. **Resource Feasibility:** Core team committed and available
3. **Technical Readiness:** Dependencies satisfied, tech proven
4. **Timeline Reasonable:** 8 weeks is aggressive but achievable
5. **Risk Manageable:** No critical blockers, mitigations in place

**Conditions:**
- Architect Alphonso approval of specifications
- Manager Mike approval of resource allocation
- Commitment to defer Phase 2 features not in scope

**Next Action:** Await approval to proceed with task creation (Batch 1 kickoff)
