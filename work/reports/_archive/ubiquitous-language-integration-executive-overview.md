**After:** 2 reference documents (23KB total) containing:
- ✅ 15+ strategic design concepts
- ✅ 6 context mapping patterns
- ✅ 12 linguistic anti-patterns
- ✅ Detection checklists for 3 agent roles

**Impact:** Developers and agents have quick reference for DDD terminology and failure modes

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Adoption Resistance
**Symptom:** Developers ignore glossary, suppress checks  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Default advisory enforcement (not blocking)
- Demonstrate value in onboarding sessions
- Make Contextive optional, not mandatory
- Celebrate early wins publicly

### Risk 2: Maintenance Burden
**Symptom:** Glossary becomes stale, diverges from reality  
**Likelihood:** High  
**Mitigation:**
- Mandatory ownership per bounded context
- Quarterly review cadence (scheduled)
- Staleness detection automation
- Clear escalation path for conflicts

### Risk 3: Over-Engineering
**Symptom:** Too many terms, excessive categorization, complex tooling  
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Start with 50-70 core terms only
- Expand incrementally based on need
- Keep Contextive setup simple
- Measure adoption, not coverage

## Conclusion

The ubiquitous language integration represents a **strategic investment** in the doctrine framework's linguistic and architectural capabilities. By treating terminology as first-class architectural concern, we enable:

- **Earlier problem detection** (language drift signals architectural drift)
- **Better team alignment** (shared vocabulary reduces miscommunication)
- **Faster onboarding** (glossary + Contextive reduces learning curve)
- **Stronger boundaries** (explicit context definitions prevent accidental coupling)

**Status:** ✅ Integration complete, initiative launched, high confidence in ROI

**Recommendation:** Approve Conceptual Alignment initiative and proceed with pilot.
