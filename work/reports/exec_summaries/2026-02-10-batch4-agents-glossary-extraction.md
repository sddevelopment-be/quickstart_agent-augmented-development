- Handoff patterns are well-specified

This batch demonstrates **exceptional definitional clarity** in the doctrine framework.

### Complete WHO-WHAT-HOW-WHY Stack

With Batch 4 complete, we now have full coverage:

| Layer | Batch | Focus | Terms | Confidence |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| **WHO** | Batch 4 | Agents | 120 | 100% |
| **WHY** | Batch 2 | Approaches | 129 | 69% |
| **HOW** | Batch 3 | Tactics | 127 | 75% |
| **WHAT** | Batch 1 | Directives | 99 | 75% |

**Total:** 475 terms covering the complete doctrine stack architecture.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Model

**Key Patterns Documented:**

1. **Spec-Driven 6-Phase Authority Flow:**
   - Phase 1-2: Analyst Annie (specification authority)
   - Phase 3-4: Architect Alphonso (architecture validation)
   - Phase 5-6: Manager Mike/Petra (orchestration)

2. **Work Directory Coordination:**
   - AGENT_STATUS.md (availability tracking)
   - WORKFLOW_LOG.md (execution history)
   - HANDOFFS.yaml (context transfer)

3. **Framework Guardian Pattern:**
   - Detects drift without overwrites
   - Preserves local intent
   - Generates upgrade guides

4. **Voice Preservation Triad:**
   - Lexical Larry: Style diagnostics
   - Editor Eddy: Minimal refinement
   - Translator: Cross-language tone matching

## Integration Strategy

### Cross-Batch Analysis Complete

**Total Extraction Results:**
- **475 terms** from **73 files** across **4 batches**
- **Average confidence:** 79% high-confidence
- **Overlap:** ~8% (30-40 terms requiring consolidation)

### Integration Timeline (4 Weeks)

**Week 1: Deduplication & Categorization**
- Merge ~30-40 overlapping terms
- Organize into 11 semantic categories
- Assign preliminary owners

**Week 2: Ownership & Enforcement**
- Map terms to bounded contexts
- Assign context owners
- Calibrate enforcement tiers (advisory/acknowledgment/hard failure)

**Week 3: Validation & Cross-Referencing**
- Domain expert validation
- Cross-reference related terms
- Configure Contextive IDE integration

**Week 4: Documentation & Rollout**
- Generate master glossary (GLOSSARY.md v2.0)
- Team onboarding materials
- IDE plugin deployment

### Priority Consolidation (Batch 4 Overlaps)

**Agent vs. Directive Overlaps:**
1. **ATDD** (Batch 1: directive, Batch 4: agent specialization)
2. **TDD** (Batch 1: directive, Batch 4: agent specialization)
3. **Boy Scout Rule** (Batch 1: directive, Batch 4: agent practice)

**Agent vs. Approach Overlaps:**
1. **Living Glossary** (Batch 2: approach, Batch 4: curator responsibility)
2. **Bounded Context** (Batch 2: approach, Batch 4: agent awareness)

**Agent vs. Tactic Overlaps:**
1. **ADR Workflow** (Batch 3: tactic, Batch 4: Alphonso's authority)
2. **Glossary Maintenance** (Batch 3: tactic, Batch 4: Claire's workflow)

**Recommendation:** Preserve multi-layered definitions (policy + philosophy + procedure + ownership).

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Integration complexity | Medium | 4-week phased plan, weekly triage sessions |
| Owner assignment | Low | Clear bounded context mapping in agent profiles |
| Maintenance burden | Low | Curator Claire designated as glossary owner |
| Adoption friction | Medium | IDE integration, PR-level validation, training |

2. **Coordinate domain experts:** SDD (Annie), DDD (Alphonso), Agents (all profiles)
3. **Plan tooling rollout:** Contextive IDE plugin with 475 terms

### For Context Owners (per agent)
1. **Validate role definitions:** Ensure agent capabilities are current
2. **Confirm collaboration patterns:** Verify handoff protocols match practice
3. **Review enforcement tiers:** Advise on which terms are advisory vs. critical

Integration complexity is manageable with clear 4-week curation plan. Ready for Curator Claire-led integration into GLOSSARY.md v2.0.

**Strategic Value:** Agent profiles complete the doctrine stack by defining WHO executes policies (directives), implements philosophies (approaches), and follows procedures (tactics).

**Overall Extraction Summary:**
- **4 batches complete:** 475 terms extracted
- **73 files processed:** 100% doctrine coverage
- **79% average confidence:** Exceptional quality
- **4-week integration plan:** Clear path to Living Glossary deployment

**Status:** ✅ **EXTRACTION COMPLETE**
