# Curation Report: Spec-Driven Cycle Meta-Analysis
**Curator Claire | Date:** 2026-02-08T0655

## Documents Reviewed
1. Meta-analysis: Spec-driven cycle violation (19,615 chars)
2. Prompt doc: 6-phase cycle template (5,236 chars)  
3. Iteration log: Full cycle execution (14,832 tokens)

## Executive Summary
✅ **Process violation successfully diagnosed and resolved**

**Problem:** Annie skipped Phase 1→5 (bypassed Architecture, Planning, Testing)  
**Root Cause:** 3 failure modes (momentum bias, awareness gap, adherence lapse)  
**Resolution:** Full 6-phase cycle executed with checkpoints (100% conformance)

## Key Findings

### Process Improvements Validated
1. **Phase Checkpoint Protocol:** ✅ EFFECTIVE (prevented all violations)
2. **Role Boundaries Table:** ✅ EFFECTIVE (zero role violations)
3. **Ralph Wiggum Loop:** ⚠️ PROPOSED (needs testing)

### Documentation Quality
- **Structure:** ✅ EXCELLENT (clear, organized, comprehensive)
- **Tone:** ✅ APPROPRIATE (self-aware, constructive, analytical)
- **Metadata:** ✅ COMPLETE (directives, dates, token counts)
- **Consistency:** ✅ PERFECT (no contradictions, aligned terminology)

## Recommendations (High Priority)
1. Integrate Phase Checkpoint Protocol into Directive 034
2. Add Role Boundaries Table to agent profiles
3. Require phase declaration in commit messages

## Verdict
**PROCESS VIOLATION SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED** ✅

**Key Takeaway:** Process violations are recoverable through honest acknowledgment, root cause analysis, documented solutions, and validation through execution.
