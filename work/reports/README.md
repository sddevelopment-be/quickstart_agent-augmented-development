## Featured Reports

### POC3 Multi-Agent Chain Validation

**Executive Summary**: [`POC3-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`](POC3-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md)  
**Detailed Assessment**: [`logs/architect/2025-11-27T2004-poc3-validation-assessment.md`](logs/architect/2025-11-27T2004-poc3-validation-assessment.md)

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ Production-ready for sequential workflows (85/100 readiness)
- 100% handoff success rate (6/6 handoffs)
- 74% efficiency improvement vs. single-agent approach
- Zero rework required across 5-agent chain
- 150.6K tokens tracked with comprehensive ADR-009 metrics

**Chain**: Architect → Diagrammer → Synthesizer → Writer-Editor → Curator

## Usage

All agents should write their final reports and logs to this directory rather than scattering outputs across the repository.

Human reviewers can consult this directory to:
- Review agent work artifacts
- Analyze system performance
- Track project progress
- Audit decision history
