# Work Reports

Temporal work products, assessments, and analysis artifacts organized by type.

## Organizational Principles

1. **Temporal Nature:** Reports in work/ are time-bound and may be archived
2. **Active Work:** Represents current or recent work cycles
3. **Reference Material:** Stable patterns/guides belong in docs/, not work/
4. **Archive Pattern:** Completed work moves to archive/ subdirectories

## Directory Structure

### `/analysis/`
In-depth analysis of code, architecture, and processes. Time-bound investigations.

### `/assessments/`
Quality assessments, strategic reviews, and evaluations.

### `/architecture/`
Architecture decision records, design reviews, and structural analysis.

### `/benchmarks/`
Performance benchmarks and results.

### `/checkpoints/`
Phase checkpoints and milestone validation records.

### `/compliance/`
Compliance checks, standards validation, and regulatory assessments.

### `/curation/`
Documentation curation, consistency audits, and structural reviews.

### `/dashboards/`
Dashboard reports and metrics visualizations.

### `/exec_summaries/`
Executive summaries of major initiatives, features, and architectural decisions.

### `/executive-summaries/`
*(Note: Consider consolidating with /exec_summaries/)*

### `/implementation/`
Implementation plans, status reports, and feature-specific documentation.

### `/logs/`
Agent execution logs and work logs, organized by agent name.

### `/metrics/`
Token usage and iteration metrics.

### `/orchestration/`
Multi-agent orchestration reports and coordination summaries.

### `/planning/`
Sprint planning, roadmaps, and strategic planning documents.

### `/pr-summaries/`
Pull request summaries and merge documentation.

### `/ralph-checks/`
Ralph Wiggum Loop prevention checks and validation reports.

### `/refactoring/`
Refactoring plans, progress tracking, and outcome assessments.

### `/reflections/`
Agent reflections, learning notes, and process observations.

### `/research/`
Research findings, explorations, and technical investigations.

### `/retrospectives/`
Sprint retrospectives, process reviews, and lessons learned.

### `/reviews/`
Code reviews, architecture reviews, and quality assessments from various agents.

### `/synthesis/`
Cross-cutting synthesis reports that integrate multiple sources or perspectives.

### `/synthesis/archive/`
Completed synthesis reports that are no longer active.

### `/validation/` and `/validations/`
Validation reports, test results, and quality verification documents.
*(Note: Consider consolidating into single /validations/ directory)*

### `/_archive/`
Archived reports from previous cycles that are no longer actively referenced.

## Featured Reports

### POC3 Multi-Agent Chain Validation

**Executive Summary**: [`POC3-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`](exec_summaries/POC3-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md)  
**Detailed Assessment**: [`logs/architect/2025-11-27T2004-poc3-validation-assessment.md`](logs/architect/2025-11-27T2004-poc3-validation-assessment.md)

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ Production-ready for sequential workflows (85/100 readiness)
- 100% handoff success rate (6/6 handoffs)
- 74% efficiency improvement vs. single-agent approach
- Zero rework required across 5-agent chain
- 150.6K tokens tracked with comprehensive ADR-009 metrics

**Chain**: Architect → Diagrammer → Synthesizer → Writer-Editor → Curator

## Directory Descriptions

### logs/

Agent-specific execution logs documenting their work, decisions, and outcomes.

**Organization**: `logs/<agent-name>/<timestamp>-<description>.md`

**Contents**:
- Work logs detailing agent activities
- Decision rationales
- Execution summaries
- Collaboration notes

### synthesizer/

Reports generated by the Synthesizer agent aggregating information from multiple sources.

**Contents**:
- Work log analyses
- Aggregate metrics
- Cross-agent coordination summaries
- System-wide insights

### benchmarks/

Performance benchmark results and analysis.

**Contents**:
- Orchestrator performance metrics
- Baseline measurements
- Comparative analysis
- Performance trends

### metrics/

Quantitative metrics tracking system usage and efficiency.

**Contents**:
- Token usage metrics
- Iteration trends
- Agent activity statistics
- Resource consumption data

## Usage

All agents should write their final reports and logs to this directory rather than scattering outputs across the repository.

Human reviewers can consult this directory to:
- Review agent work artifacts
- Analyze system performance
- Track project progress
- Audit decision history

## Related Directories

- `work/collaboration/` - Orchestration and task coordination
- `work/external_memory/` - Temporary inter-agent context sharing
