# Agent Reports

This directory consolidates all agent output files, logs, and metrics for easy review.

## Structure

```

```

## Directory Descriptions

### logs/

Agent-specific execution logs documenting their work, decisions, and outcomes.

**Organization**: `logs/<agent-name>/<timestamp>-<description>.md`

**Contents**:
- Work logs detailing agent activities
- Decision rationales
- Execution summaries
- Collaboration notes

### synthesizer/

Reports generated by the Synthesizer agent aggregating information from multiple sources.

**Contents**:
- Work log analyses
- Aggregate metrics
- Cross-agent coordination summaries
- System-wide insights

### benchmarks/

Performance benchmark results and analysis.

**Contents**:
- Orchestrator performance metrics
- Baseline measurements
- Comparative analysis
- Performance trends

### metrics/

Quantitative metrics tracking system usage and efficiency.

**Contents**:
- Token usage metrics
- Iteration trends
- Agent activity statistics
- Resource consumption data

## Usage

All agents should write their final reports and logs to this directory rather than scattering outputs across the repository.

Human reviewers can consult this directory to:
- Review agent work artifacts
- Analyze system performance
- Track project progress
- Audit decision history
