# Manager Mike Orchestration Plan

- Initiative: Spec Kitty deep-dive linguistic analysis
- Target repo: `/media/stijnd/DATA/development/projects/forks/spec-kitty`
- Mode: `/analysis-mode`
- Timestamp: 2026-02-14T15:33:09Z

## Objective
Produce a per-domain conceptual capture of Spec Kitty terminology in `work/kitty/glossary`.

## Delegation Matrix
1. `analyst-annie`: discover bounded contexts and domain boundaries from docs + architecture.
2. `lexical`: extract and normalize high-signal terminology from code/docs/tests.
3. `architect-alphonso`: define cross-domain conceptual map and boundary translations.
4. `curator-claire`: assemble final glossary package with per-domain files and core term index.

## Execution Status
- `analyst-annie`: ✅ completed
- `lexical`: ✅ completed
- `architect-alphonso`: ✅ completed
- `curator-claire`: ✅ completed

## Alignment
- ✅ Bounded-context linguistic discovery applied.
- ✅ Living glossary practice applied.
- ⚠️ Inference note: context ownership by team was inferred from module and workflow boundaries (no org chart in source repo).
