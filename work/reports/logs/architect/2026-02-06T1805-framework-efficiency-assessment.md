# Architect Work Log - 2026-02-06

## Task
Assess agentic framework efficiency trends (quality-to-cost ratio) using aggregated token metrics.

## Findings
- Dependency exists as a work log (`work/reports/logs/synthesizer/2025-11-24T1830-token-metrics-aggregation.md`).
- The referenced output artifact `work/metrics/token-metrics-2025-11-24.json` is missing from the repository, so the dataset cannot be reviewed.
- Target ADR identifier conflicts with existing ADR-012 (`docs/architecture/adrs/ADR-012-test-driven-defaults.md`).

## Decision
- Marked task as **blocked** pending:
  1. Restoration or regeneration of `work/metrics/token-metrics-2025-11-24.json`.
  2. Clarification on correct ADR number or alternative document location for efficiency assessment.

## Recommended Next Steps
- Recreate the token metrics JSON (source logs are still present).
- Define a new ADR number or use an assessment doc under `docs/architecture/assessments/`.

## Status
Blocked.
