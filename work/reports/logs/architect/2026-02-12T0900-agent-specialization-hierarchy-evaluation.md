# Work Log: Agent Specialization Hierarchy Evaluation

**Agent:** architect-alphonso
**Task ID:** N/A (ad-hoc architectural evaluation)
**Date:** 2026-02-12T09:00:00Z
**Status:** in-progress

## Context

Human stakeholder requested architectural review of proposed agent specialization hierarchy concept:

**Problem Statement:**
- Orchestration system (Manager Mike) currently favors generic "backend-dev" specialist over more specific Java/Python specialists
- Specialization is working well in practice, but routing/delegation is suboptimal
- Need to formalize concept of agent inheritance/sub-specialists

**Proposed Solution:**
- Establish Java Jenny and Python Pedro as "expertise-based refinements" of Backend Benny
- Use stack-specific specialists when working in their respective contexts
- Use Backend Benny as fallback when no more appropriate expert available

**Implementation Scope:**
- DDR (Decision Record)
- Delegation, coordination, and orchestration tactics/approaches
- Domain glossary updates
- Logical domain models (DDD-based methodology)

**Constraints:**
- No changes yet—evaluation and implementation guidance only
- Adhere to Directives 014 (Work Log) and 015 (Store Prompts)

## Approach

Following Architect Alphonso specialization: systemic decomposition, trade-off analysis, explicit decision rationale.

**Analysis Strategy:**
1. Load existing agent profiles (Backend Benny, Java Jenny, Python Pedro)
2. Load existing orchestration patterns (Manager Mike, DDR-007)
3. Review glossary for existing specialization terminology
4. Evaluate proposal against doctrine stack principles
5. Identify impact zones (domain model, orchestration, delegation, glossary)
6. Ask clarifying questions
7. Provide implementation roadmap

## Guidelines & Directives Used

- **General Guidelines:** ✅ Loaded (32 lines)
- **Operational Guidelines:** ✅ Loaded (57 lines)
- **Bootstrap Protocol:** ✅ Loaded (72 lines)
- **DOCTRINE_STACK.md:** ✅ Loaded (304 lines)
- **Specific Directives:**
  - 014 (Work Log Creation): Work log structure and requirements
  - 015 (Store Prompts): Optional prompt documentation guidance
  - 018 (Traceable Decisions): ADR/DDR documentation standards
  - 007 (Agent Declaration): Authority confirmation
- **Agent Profile:** architect.agent.md (111 lines)
- **Reasoning Mode:** /analysis-mode

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Context Loading ✅

Loaded:
- `doctrine/agents/backend-dev.agent.md` (83 lines)
- `doctrine/agents/java-jenny.agent.md` (87 lines)
- `doctrine/agents/python-pedro.agent.md` (214 lines)
- `doctrine/agents/manager.agent.md` (242 lines)
- `doctrine/decisions/DDR-007-coordinator-agent-orchestration-pattern.md` (384 lines)
- `doctrine/GLOSSARY.md` (searched for specialization terminology)

**Key Findings:**
- Current agent profiles define specialization boundaries but no inheritance concept
- Backend Benny: "API/service design, persistence strategy, performance budgets"
- Java Jenny: "Java implementation, code quality, style enforcement, testing"
- Python Pedro: "Python 3.9+ code quality, idioms, type hints, testing with pytest"
- Manager Mike: Delegates to agents but task assignment logic not explicitly documented
- DDR-007: Coordinator pattern exists but agent selection algorithm not specified
- Glossary: "Specialization Boundary" defined but no inheritance/refinement concept

### Step 2: Architectural Analysis (in-progress)

Analyzing proposal through multiple lenses:
1. **Domain Model Impact** - how does this change agent taxonomy?
2. **Orchestration Impact** - how does routing/delegation change?
3. **Coordination Impact** - how do agents discover sub-specialists?
4. **Glossary Impact** - what new terminology needs definition?
5. **Backwards Compatibility** - impact on existing tasks/workflows?

### Step 3: Clarifying Questions ✅

**Responses received:**
- Q1: Hybrid A/B - SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT tactic + agent metadata for parent
- Q2: Yes to upward delegation via normal handoff
- Q3: Generalize (writing style, domain knowledge, etc.)
- Q4: Language-based for programming; consider workload + complexity; Mike decides ties
- Q5: Mike does "reassignment pass" for legacy tasks
- Q6: Yes, handoffs trigger SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT (including .doctrine-config specialists)

### Step 4: Implementation Roadmap ✅

Comprehensive implementation plan provided based on clarifications.

## Artifacts Created

- This work log: `work/reports/logs/architect/2026-02-12T0900-agent-specialization-hierarchy-evaluation.md`

## Outcomes

- ✅ Architectural evaluation completed
- ✅ Clarifying questions answered by stakeholder
- ✅ Detailed implementation roadmap provided
- ✅ DDR structure drafted
- ✅ Tactic structure defined (SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT)
- ✅ Impact on existing components identified
- 📝 Next: Human to approve roadmap, create implementation tasks

## Lessons Learned

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Agent hierarchy is analogous to class inheritance in OOP
- Context-based routing mirrors dependency injection container resolution
- Priority system prevents ambiguity (similar to specificity in CSS)

**Architecture Insights:**
- Hybrid approaches (explicit + implicit) balance discoverability with flexibility
- Local .doctrine-config specialists create powerful customization point
- Reassignment pass pattern handles migration gracefully

**Framework Evolution:**
- This hierarchy concept extends naturally to all specialist types (not just language)
- SELECT_APPROPRIATE_AGENT tactic becomes reusable across handoff scenarios
- Workload + complexity factors prevent specialist overload

**Risks Identified:**
- Circular dependencies possible if hierarchy poorly configured (needs validation)
- Complex routing logic requires thorough testing
- Reassignment pass could be expensive on large task sets (needs optimization)
