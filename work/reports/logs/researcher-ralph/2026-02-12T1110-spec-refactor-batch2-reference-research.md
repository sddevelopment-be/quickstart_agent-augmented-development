# Work Log: SPEC-REFACTOR Batch 2 Reference Research

**Agent:** researcher-ralph  
**Task ID:** 2026-02-12T1105-researcher-refactoring-reference-expansion  
**Date:** 2026-02-12T11:10:00Z  
**Status:** completed

## Context

Manager initiated Batch 2 of SPEC-REFACTOR to cover remaining reference material in `work/tasks/learning_refactoring_plan.md` that was not turned into doctrine artifacts during Batch 1.

## Approach

I focused on high-yield sources across four buckets: low-level refactorings, refactoring-to-patterns transitions, architecture patterns, and Fowler conceptual clarifications. Output was constrained to doctrine-actionable format (topic -> applicability -> risk -> artifact type).

## Guidelines & Directives Used

- General Guidelines: yes
- Operational Guidelines: yes
- Specific Directives: 014, 019
- Agent Profile: researcher-ralph
- Reasoning Mode: /analysis-mode

## Execution Steps

1. Loaded remaining source list from `learning_refactoring_plan.md`.
2. Fetched key references across Refactoring.Guru, Industrial Logic, Azure patterns, and Fowler essays/bliki.
3. Built a compact evidence matrix for remaining topics.
4. Produced curated Batch 2 recommendations (new tactics vs references).
5. Updated task result and completed lifecycle to done.

## Artifacts Created

- `work/research/2026-02-12-refactoring-reference-expansion.md` - Batch 2 evidence matrix and recommended doctrine outputs
- `work/collaboration/done/researcher/2026-02-12T1105-researcher-refactoring-reference-expansion.yaml` - completed task state
- `work/reports/logs/researcher-ralph/2026-02-12T1110-spec-refactor-batch2-reference-research.md` - this work log

## Outcomes

- Remaining source material is now synthesized into actionable doctrine backlog.
- Curator task `1106` is unblocked with concrete artifact targets.

## Lessons Learned

- Separating deterministic code refactorings from architecture-level escalation patterns keeps tactic scope clean.
- A matrix with explicit output-type recommendation reduces curation ambiguity downstream.
