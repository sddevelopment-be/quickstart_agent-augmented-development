## Major Changes Summary

### Sections DELETED (7 major sections, 367 lines)
1. **Success Metrics table** - Unvalidated estimates
2. **Strategic Goals** - Aspirational roadmap (short/mid/long-term)
3. **Roadmap** - Operational planning with timelines
4. **Competitive Landscape** - Sales comparisons with other tools
5. **Success Stories** - Promotional case studies
6. **Call to Action** - Marketing copy
7. **Conclusion** - Inspirational rally cry

### Sections EXTRACTED (1 section, 70 lines → separate file)
- **Core Use Cases** → `doctrine/docs/workflows/core-use-cases.md`

### Sections ENHANCED (2 sections)
- **"Market Gap" → "What's Missing"** - Sublimated to neutral problem statement
- **"Role of Agents"** - Added customizability, feedback loops, centralization patterns

### Content REMOVED
- ALL Sprint 1 performance metrics (8x efficiency, 670 fixes, ROI claims)
- ALL artifact counts (21 agents, 34 directives, 50 tactics, 45 ADRs)
- ALL sales/marketing language ("unique", "only", "paradigm shift", "de facto standard")
- ALL competitive positioning ("better than", "only framework with")
- ALL aspirational business plans (Marketplace, Certification, Academy, Enterprise features)

---

## Document Focus Transformation

### BEFORE: Promotional Document
- ❌ Sales-oriented ("Market Gap", "Unique Value Propositions")
- ❌ Competitive positioning ("Only framework with...")
- ❌ Performance claims without formal validation
- ❌ Aspirational roadmaps and business plans
- ❌ Inspirational calls to action
- ❌ Mix of vision, roadmap, marketing, and tutorials

### AFTER: Strategic Vision Document
- ✅ Problem-focused ("What's Missing")
- ✅ Capability-focused ("Core Capabilities")
- ✅ Principle-driven (Guiding Philosophy preserved)
- ✅ Honest about risks and boundaries
- ✅ Clear cross-references to detailed docs
- ✅ Pure vision: strategic direction, principles, boundaries

---

## Remaining Sprint 1 References (Contextually Appropriate)

Only 2 references remain, both appropriate:

1. **Risk Mitigation Table** (Line 410)
   - Context: "Quick wins (Sprint 1 case study)" as mitigation for adoption resistance
   - Rationale: References case study as documentation example, not promotional metric

2. **Related Documents** (Line 434)
   - Context: Link to `work/reports/SPRINT1_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
   - Rationale: Appropriate cross-reference for those seeking empirical case study

---

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines reduced | 367 (46.2%) |
| Sections deleted | 7 major sections |
| Marketing terms removed | 25+ |
| Sprint 1 references removed | 10 of 12 |
| Artifact counts removed | 15 instances |
| New sections added | 2 (Customizability, Feedback) |
| Files created | 2 (use cases, logs) |

## Recommendations

### VISION.md Maintenance Guidelines

**Should contain:**
- Strategic direction and long-term outcomes
- Core principles and philosophies
- Scope boundaries
- Problem statements (neutral, factual)
- Solution architecture (high-level)
- Risk assessments

**Should NOT contain:**
- Performance metrics or ROI claims
- Competitive comparisons
- Operational roadmaps or timelines
- Promotional case studies
- Calls to action
- Historical project data

**Separate documents for:**
- Roadmap → Project management docs
- Case studies → `work/reports/`
- Tutorials → `docs/`
- Workflows → `doctrine/docs/workflows/`
- Marketing → Separate marketing materials

---

## Conclusion

VISION.md successfully transformed from promotional document to strategic vision document. The revision removes all sales/marketing language, aspirational content, and historical metrics while preserving essential technical vision and principles.

The document now serves as a timeless north star for framework direction, with tactical details appropriately separated into specialized documents.
