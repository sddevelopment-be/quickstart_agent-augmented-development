# Writer-Editor Work Log - 2026-02-06

## Task
Update documentation to reflect new script organization.

## Actions
- Updated `docs/HOW_TO_USE/multi-agent-orchestration.md` with current script locations:
  - `ops/orchestration/agent_orchestrator.py`
  - `ops/orchestration/task_utils.py`
  - `validation/validate-task-schema.py`, `validation/validate-work-structure.sh`, `validation/validate-task-naming.sh`

## Notes
- No `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` file exists in the repository; no update performed there.
- Broader doc drift (legacy `work/scripts/*` references) documented in curator validation log for follow-up batch.

## Status
Completed documentation update. Task moved to done.
