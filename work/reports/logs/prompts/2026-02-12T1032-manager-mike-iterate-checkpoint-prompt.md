## Original Problem Statement

> "/iterate"

---

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

- Very fast command for recurring orchestration checkpoints.

### Weaknesses

- Lacks explicit scope (which initiative? which phase?).

### Opportunities

- Expand shorthand to default: "check active initiative, verify trigger artifact, update workflow log."

### Threats

- Ambiguity can lead to inconsistent iteration behavior between runs.

## Suggested Improvements

```text
/iterate spec-refactor-001
```

or

```text
/iterate active-initiative
```

with documented default actions.
