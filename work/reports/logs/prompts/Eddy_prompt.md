
Goal:
Share information about a agent-enhanced test validation approach. 

Context:
An experiment was performed to assess the quality of test suites as documentation for software development. The approach aims to improve the quality of the test suite, the quality of the code under test, and the overall documentation quality. The experiment involved using agents to generate tests based on existing test cases.

- .github/agents/approaches/test-readability-clarity-check.md : a description of the approach, targeted at agents
- work/reports/prompts/2025-11-29T0652-qualitative-study-prompt.md : The original prompt used to conduct the experiment.
- docs/templates/prompts/TEST_READABILITY_CHECK.prompt.md : The prompt to be used to execute the experiment in the future.
- work/notes/ralph_system_analysis_from_tests.md : Ralph's system analysis from the test suite.
- work/notes/alphonso_architecture_review.md : Alphonso's architecture review based on Ralph's assessment.
- work/reports/logs/build-automation/2025-11-29T0652-qualitative-test-study.md

Task:
- Write a report summarizing the results of the experimen. Target audience: the team.
  - Include a discussion of the tradeoffs involved in using agents for test generation and validation.
  - Include a discussion of the benefits of using agents for test generation and validation.
- Write an article discussing the approach used. Target audience: technical coaches, process architects, software engineers
- Write an article discussing the approach used. Target audience: power users, managers
- Write an article discussing the approach used. Target audience: non-technical educators

Additional Context:

A previous attempt to create these reporting articles was made. The results are stored in the `docs/articles` directory. Suggested approach is to review these, highlight why they miss the mark, and create a new set of articles.
