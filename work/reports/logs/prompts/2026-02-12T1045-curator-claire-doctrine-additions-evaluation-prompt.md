## Original Problem Statement

> "As Curator Claire: Evaluate the proposed additions to the doctrine. Adjust/Edit if needed."

---

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

- Clear role and authority boundary (Curator Claire).
- Explicitly allows judgment (accept, adjust, edit), not just mechanical execution.

### Weaknesses

- "Proposed additions" is implicit and relies on prior context continuity.
- No explicit acceptance criteria for what "good enough" looks like.

### Opportunities

- Add explicit artifact scope (tactics, references, directives, index).
- Specify required governance constraints (procedural tactics, doctrine-local references, no policy duplication).

### Threats

- Ambiguity could lead to partial edits without doctrine integration.
- Different agents could interpret "evaluate" as review-only and skip implementation.

## Suggested Improvements

```text
As Curator Claire, evaluate and implement the proposed SPEC-REFACTOR additions:
1) curate first-wave refactoring tactics,
2) create doctrine-local refactoring reference files,
3) integrate them into Directive 039 and doctrine/tactics/README,
4) complete tasks 0911-0913 with handoff metadata.
Apply only doctrine-local references and keep tactics procedural.
```
