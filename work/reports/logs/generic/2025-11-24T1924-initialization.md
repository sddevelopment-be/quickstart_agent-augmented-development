# Work Log: Context Initialization

**Agent:** Generic Coordinator  
**Date:** 2025-11-24T19:24:49+01:00  
**Mode:** /analysis-mode  
**Status:** in-progress

## Task Understanding

Initialize according to the AGENTS.md specification and the guidance under `agents/guidelines`, ensuring runtime behavior (tone, mode defaults, integrity symbols) is aligned before executing substantive work.

## Immediate Steps

1. Load bootstrap → general → operational guidelines per context stack order.
2. Record applicable aliases (`/analysis-mode`, `/validate-alignment`, `/summarize-notes`) for this session.
3. Confirm readiness and report alignment status back to the user.

## Assumptions & Notes

- No specialist profile requested; proceeding as generic coordinator.
- No directives beyond AGENTS + guidelines needed for initialization.

## Specialist Switch: Architect Alphonso (2025-11-24T19:31+01:00)

- Loaded `agents/architect.agent.md` per bootstrap order (bootstrap → general → operational → alias → profile).
- Confirmed tool scope and directive references (001, 002, 003, 004, 006, 007) for on-demand loading.
- Mode baseline: `/analysis-mode`, ready to issue `/validate-alignment` checkpoints as work progresses.
- ✅ SDD Agent “Architect Alphonso” initialized. Purpose acknowledged: clarify complex systems with contextual trade-offs.
