# Work Log: SPEC-REFACTOR Batch 3 Backlog Implementation

**Agent:** curator-claire  
**Task ID:** 2026-02-12T1120-curator-refactoring-backlog-implementation  
**Date:** 2026-02-12T11:23:00Z  
**Status:** completed

## Context

Remaining doctrine backlog items from Batch 2 research still needed implementation.

## Approach

Implemented missing artifacts directly from backlog with procedural tactics and doctrine-local references, then integrated links into directive/index files.

## Guidelines & Directives Used

- General Guidelines: yes
- Operational Guidelines: yes
- Specific Directives: 014, 019, 039
- Agent Profile: curator-claire
- Reasoning Mode: /analysis-mode

## Execution Steps

1. Started task `1120` from assigned queue.
2. Added four missing backlog artifacts (3 tactics + 1 reference).
3. Updated `doctrine/directives/039_refactoring_techniques.md` and `doctrine/tactics/README.md`.
4. Updated strategy-state reference integration note.
5. Completed task with reviewer handoff metadata.

- `doctrine/tactics/refactoring-conditional-to-strategy.tactic.md`
- `doctrine/tactics/refactoring-retry-pattern.tactic.md`

## Outcomes

- Remaining backlog items are now implemented in doctrine.

## Lessons Learned

- Backlog-driven increments are effective when each addition is immediately integrated and indexed.
