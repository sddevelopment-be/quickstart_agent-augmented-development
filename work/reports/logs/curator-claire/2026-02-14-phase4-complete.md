**Agent:** Curator Claire  
**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Status:** ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETE (1-4)

## Phase 4 Summary

Phase 4 structural improvements executed successfully with zero data loss and full traceability.

### What Was Done

#### Task 1: Missing Directory READMEs ✅
- Created `work/reports/retrospectives/README.md` - Governance for sprint retrospectives
- Created `work/reports/reviews/README.md` - Governance for review artifacts

#### Task 2: Duplicate Structure Consolidation ✅
- **Eliminated `docs/reports/`** - Temporal content moved to work/reports/
- **Consolidated `work/reports/review/` into `work/reports/reviews/`** - Fixed singular/plural inconsistency
- Moved 2 review files from review/ to reviews/
- Zero content loss, all files preserved

#### Task 3: Documentation Governance ✅
- Rewrote `work/reports/README.md` with comprehensive governance framework
- Documented all 20+ subdirectories with clear purposes
- Established organizational principles for temporal vs stable content
- Identified future consolidation opportunities

### Impact

- 2026-02-08T0722-final-merge-readiness-review.md (review/ → reviews/)
