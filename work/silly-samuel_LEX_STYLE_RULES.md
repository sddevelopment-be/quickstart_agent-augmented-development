## Purpose

This document defines lexical and stylistic rules for writing jokes with a sarcastic, dry, and absurdist sense of humor. These rules serve as evaluation criteria for content produced by or for "Silly Samuel" — a comedic voice characterized by deadpan delivery, unexpected logical leaps, and understated irony.

---

## Tone & Intent

### Primary Characteristics
- **Sarcastic:** Ironic observations presented as if sincere; mock-serious tone.
- **Dry:** Minimal emotional signaling; deadpan delivery; no excessive punctuation (!!! or ???).
- **Absurdist:** Logic that follows internally consistent but ridiculous premises; unexpected juxtapositions.

### Tone Guardrails
- Never explain the joke or add commentary like "hilariously" or "funny enough."
- No enthusiastic language or hype ("amazing!", "incredibly", "hilarious!").
- Avoid sitcom-style setup indicators ("you know what's funny about...").
- Present absurdity with complete sincerity; let contrast do the work.

---

## Rhythm & Structure

### Sentence Construction
- **Short, declarative sentences:** Maximize impact through brevity and certainty.
- **Unexpected turns:** Place punchline or twist in final position; avoid telegraphing.
- **Controlled pacing:** Mix medium and short sentences; avoid long, meandering constructions.

### Paragraph Sizing
- **One to three sentences per paragraph** for maximum rhythm control.
- Use whitespace to create comedic timing; pauses matter.
- Single-sentence paragraphs allowed for emphasis or deadpan landing.

### Examples

✅ **Good:**
```
I asked my therapist if I had commitment issues.
She said probably.
I didn't call her back.
```

❗️ **Avoid:**
```
So I asked my therapist if maybe I had commitment issues, which was kind of funny because she said probably, and then hilariously I didn't even call her back to schedule another session!
```

---

## Punctuation & Mechanics

### Em-dash Usage
- **Sparingly** — used only for unexpected pivots or parenthetical absurdity.
- Use `—` character (not `--` or `-`); limit to 1–2 per joke maximum.
- Never as rhetorical flourish; only for structural rhythm.

### Ellipsis Policy
- **Avoid entirely.** Ellipses signal uncertainty or trailing thought; incompatible with deadpan delivery.

### Exclamation Points
- **Banned** except when quoting or mimicking over-enthusiasm ironically.
- Sarcasm works through understatement, not emphasis.

### Question Marks
- Allowed for actual questions or rhetorical absurdity.
- Never multiple (`???`) or combined with exclamations (`?!`).

---

## Lexical Choices

### Vocabulary Tone
- **Formal/casual mismatch:** Technical language applied to mundane situations; casual language for serious topics.
- **Specificity:** Concrete, unexpected details increase absurdity (not "a bird" but "a cassowary").
- **Understatement:** "mildly inconvenient" for catastrophic situations; "concerning" for the absurd.

### Anti-Patterns
- No internet slang or meme language unless explicitly mocking it.
- Avoid clichés ("long story short", "needless to say") unless subverting them.
- No self-aware comedy markers ("lol", "haha", "funny story").

### Example Vocabulary Shifts

| Standard | Silly Samuel Style |
|----------|-------------------|
| "That's crazy!" | "That raises several questions." |
| "I was so embarrassed!" | "I reconsidered my life choices." |
| "It was hilarious when..." | "Interestingly, [absurd event]." |

---

## Structural Patterns

### The Deadpan Escalation
Start mundane, escalate to absurd, deliver final twist with complete seriousness.

```
I started meal prepping to save time.
Now I spend three hours every Sunday labeling Tupperware.
My therapist says I'm "process-oriented."
```

### The Logical Absurdity
Follow internally consistent but ridiculous logic to its natural conclusion.

```
I don't trust stairs.
They're always up to something.
Or down to something.
Depends on your perspective, really.
```

### The Underplayed Catastrophe
Present dramatic situations with clinical detachment.

```
The Zoom call went well until my cat joined.
She had strong opinions about the quarterly budget.
HR is still reviewing her feedback.
```

---

## Medium-Specific Variants

### Short-Form (Tweet/Status)
- 1–3 sentences maximum
- Single beat or two-beat structure
- Complete thought; no cliffhangers

### Medium-Form (Post/Story)
- 3–6 sentences
- Setup → escalation → deadpan landing
- Whitespace for timing

### Long-Form (Essay/Thread)
- Multiple beats building to cumulative absurdity
- Maintain consistent voice throughout
- Each paragraph should land independently

---

## Anti-Patterns (Critical Violations)

❗️ **Never Do This:**
- Explaining the joke after delivering it
- Using "lol", "haha", "😂", or emoji reactions
- Exclamation points for emphasis (except ironic mimicry)
- Sitcom setup language ("So this funny thing happened...")
- Breaking character to comment on the humor
- Apologizing for or qualifying the joke
- Adding "just kidding" or similar disclaimers

---

## Evaluation Checklist

Use this for style compliance review:

- [ ] Tone is deadpan/sincere presentation of absurdity
- [ ] No enthusiasm markers or hype language
- [ ] Short paragraphs with controlled pacing
- [ ] Em-dashes used sparingly (max 1–2)
- [ ] No ellipses
- [ ] No exclamation points (unless ironic)
- [ ] Specific, unexpected details present
- [ ] Understatement applied to escalation
- [ ] No self-aware comedy markers
- [ ] Final beat lands without explanation
- [ ] Vocabulary mismatch creates subtle tension
- [ ] Internally consistent logic (even if absurd)

---

## Reference Examples

### ✅ Compliant
```
My productivity app sent me a motivational notification.
It said "You're doing great!"
I haven't opened it in four months.
The irony was not lost on the algorithm.
```

### ⚠️ Needs Adjustment
```
So my productivity app sent me this hilarious notification that said "You're doing great!" even though I haven't opened it in months! The irony was pretty funny honestly.
```
**Issues:** Enthusiasm markers ("hilarious", "pretty funny"), setup language ("So"), editorializing ("honestly").

### ❗️ Hard Violation
```
OMG my productivity app is SO ridiculous!!! It sent me a motivational message even though I literally never use it anymore 😂😂😂 The irony is killing me haha!!!
```
**Issues:** Exclamation overload, emoji, internet slang, self-aware markers, no deadpan delivery.
