    definition: "Type-safe identifier for agent specializations"
    context: "Task Domain"
    status: "canonical"
    source: "src/common/types.py"
    purpose: "Ensures valid agent references, prevents typos in agent names"
    examples:
      - "architect-alphonso"
      - "python-pedro"
      - "curator-claire"
      - "code-reviewer-cindy"

    implementation: "src/common/types.py: AgentIdentity(str) with validation"
    
  - term: "TaskDescriptor"
    definition: "YAML-serializable representation of a task for file I/O operations"
    context: "Task Domain"
    status: "proposed"
    rationale: "Replaces raw Dict[str, Any] usage, provides semantic clarity"
    structure:
      - "id: Unique task identifier (ISO timestamp + agent + slug)"
      - "title: Human-readable task summary"
      - "description: Detailed task requirements"
      - "agent: Target agent identity"

    related_terms:
      - "Task File (Orchestration Context)"
      - "Serialize/Deserialize (Orchestration Context)"
    
  - term: "TaskAggregate"
    definition: "Domain model representation of task with business logic"
    context: "Task Domain"
    status: "proposed"
    rationale: "Separates domain logic from file I/O concerns"
    responsibilities:
      - "Validate task state transitions"
      - "Enforce business rules (e.g., priority constraints)"
      - "Calculate derived properties (e.g., time in state)"
      - "Emit domain events (future)"
    note: "TaskDescriptor (Orchestration) is serialized form of TaskAggregate (Domain)"
    related_terms:
      - "TaskDescriptor (serialization layer)"
      - "Task File (persistence layer)"

# Anti-Corruption Layer Vocabulary
# (Translation between Task Domain and other contexts)

  - term: "Task Translation"
    definition: "Conversion between TaskAggregate (domain) and TaskDescriptor (I/O)"
    context: "Task Domain (ACL)"
    status: "proposed"
    patterns:
      - "TaskAggregate → TaskDescriptor: serialize_task()"
      - "TaskDescriptor → TaskAggregate: parse_task()"
    rationale: "Isolates domain logic from file format changes"
    
  - term: "Status Transition Validator"
    definition: "Component that validates TaskStatus state transitions"
    context: "Task Domain"
    status: "proposed"
    valid_transitions:
      inbox: ["assigned", "error"]
      assigned: ["in_progress", "blocked", "error"]
      in_progress: ["done", "blocked", "error"]
      blocked: ["in_progress", "error"]
      done: []  # terminal state
      error: []  # terminal state
