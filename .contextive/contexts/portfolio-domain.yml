    rationale: "Dashboard context has rich domain vocabulary not in any glossary. Created separate bounded context glossary."
    source: "work/terminology-validation-report.md, Section 3.3"
    decision: "Extract portfolio domain into separate glossary per bounded context principle"
    note: "Generic class names (TaskAssignmentHandler, SpecificationCache) should be refactored per domain-driven-naming.md"
